This repository is intended to be a comprehensive collection of fiction texts published under Creative Commons licenses. This is in contrast to texts in the public domain, for which excellent repositories already exist (e.g., Project Gutenberg), as well as nonfiction Creative Commons texts, which are also well covered (e.g., Wikipedia). But no equivalent collection for CC fiction seems to exist at the time of writing. The closest is Wikipedia's "Creative Commons-licensed novels" category, but it only includes works notable enough to have their own articles, and is therefore incomplete. (And in any case, Wikipedia doesn't actually host the full text of those works — only links to them — which makes enumerating the collection difficult.)

The good and bad news is that the Creative Commons fiction "canon" appears to be fairly small. The public domain corpus is far too large for any one person to read, and likewise for CC nonfiction. But novel-length CC fiction texts seems to number only in the dozens. This makes hosting the complete set in a single Git repository feasible, as well as reading through each work as part of adding them (to better understand what's being included). That process should be doable over the course of a few months, after which this README will be updated to reflect the completed status of the collection.
