I was six the first time Emma Jean and I held hands. My parents knew her parents. It was easy being six, with her to hold my hand. I don't remember falling in love with her. It was too powerful a thing to. It made whatever came before it into smoke, meaningless and gray.

"Em," I'd say to her, "I've got a hole in me, and only ice cream'll fill it." Or soda pop. Or a burger from the diner down the corner that burnt down a couple of years later. I'd say any one of those things, whichever of them was on the opposite side of the street from us, and nearer. We had to hold hands to cross the street, you see. One of our hands would usually be sticky, or smudged with dirt, but that didn't matter.

When I was eight and she still languished at seven, she kissed me. Em was sixteen days younger than me. Those sixteen days gave me all the wisdom of the world, back then, back when all that mattered was getting big as fast as you can.

"Davie," she'd say, "tell me a why." Just like that, right out of the blue. "Tell me a why."

And I would. "Because the earth is spinning so fast," or "Because of all the dust in the air, my dad says." Whatever new fact I had that maybe she didn't. Sometimes my why would be answer enough to whatever question she had inside her, and sometimes it wouldn't, but every time, until the last one, she smiled and closed her eyes all dreamy-like, then nodded like it was pretty sage advice all the same.

That last time, though, Emma Jean cleaned me right out of whys. I scraped the bottom of the barrel, and nothing I had seemed to fit. We were thirteen, just learning how to kiss and really mean it. I was holding her hand, out there in that field. Everything around us was golden and dry, ready to be bundled and sold. Our hands were gritty with wheat powder. We itched from it. My becauses had gotten better, as I'd gotten older, but that last time they just weren't good enough.

"Because we came from the apes, unless you listen to the preacher." I was getting desperate, and Em knew it. She didn't answer. "Because we put a man on the moon."

Nothing.

I played my ace, the one my dad had taught me best. "Because of the damn Russians."

She didn't even blink.

"That's all I know, Emma. My head's empty. Whatever why you're looking for, I just don't have it. Forgive me?" I puckered up and closed my eyes.

I'm certain that's how she remembered me, after that. A couple years later I got drafted, and the entire time all I was sure of was that when Emma Jean pictured me, it was as a dumb kid with his eyes squeezed shut tight, lips pressed together like he'd just eaten a lemon, begging for a kiss she didn't want to give.

I don't know what her face looked like when she said the words back in that wheat field. My eyes were still closed. "Why do my parents have to move? Why do they have to take me with them?"

I was thirteen when I learned that there are more questions than there are answers in the world.

So much of the middle of this thing doesn't matter. I drifted, without Em to hold my hand. I managed to get drafted just in time to leave a few pieces of me over there before it ended. Not enough to notice, just by looking at me, accept for the limp, but more than enough for my liking.

I started writing to Emma Jean on the day I arrived in Nam, and I kept it up. My mail never got answered, and it never got returned. I almost gave her name and address as my next of kin, just so that if something happened to me she'd know, but I didn't. I walked through the end of that war with a hole I couldn't fill, and Charlie made a few more, with bullets or shrapnel and sticks smeared in shit. I plugged those holes anyway I could, but nothing took.

I swung, like a pendulum, between hoping the address was right and my letters were touching her soul, and praying that she'd moved again. Maybe someone I didn't know set my mail, unopened, in some drawer, unsure of how to tell a love struck soldier he was alone.

My wife, once all that was past and I'd stopped pushing the world away turned out to have Russian parents. Imagine that. Anyone who thinks that having Russian parents makes you Russian doesn't know how these things work. Kate was born in America, and it looks like that makes a world of difference.

Kate was a dancer, before I met her, the classy kind, a ballerina, not like those dead-eyed whores that stumble and strut through the streets of Nam. She teaches ballet, now, in a studio we bought when the last owner got tired of watching little girls not live up to their parents' expectations. On occasion, I take my walking stick and limp down there to watch my wife.

The main wall in the studio's foyer is just one big window, so the doting parents can watch the girls practice. I was the only one there, so early in the session, and I sat on the couch that'd followed me from house to house like a threadbare puppy. The studio had been soundproofed. Music that was all encompassing in there was reduced to the soft lilt of flutes and the thrum of a cello out here, with me. Just as well. It meant that when Emma Jean sat down beside me and I dropped my stick, nobody heard the clatter but me.

"Davie," she said, her voice a ragged whisper, "tell me a why."

Her hair was lank and her eyes were flat and dull as flint. I'd seen eyes like that too many times before. She was too thin, all angles and edges. Her skin was stretched so tight I was afraid it'd tear. She lay her hand in mine, and her knuckles shifted against one another like ball bearings when I gave it a squeeze.

"Emma."

Kate and her students had their backs to us. They watched themselves spin and kick in the mirror set into the opposite wall. Pirouette and kicked, I guess is the technical term. They held their hands high, and a few of them broke into giggles at something Kate had said.

"Davie, I got a hole in me that only you can fill." That's what I heard, at least. Out loud, she said "I've got a hole in me only smack can fill," or sex, or pain, or whatever else had made her into this. The whole room slanted toward her, ever so slightly, from every direction, like I was in a swimming pool and someone had pulled the plug. I could see the couch through her, right on through to the threadbare armrest. I could see enough to know she didn't just have a hole. Emma Jean was a hole herself.

"I missed you, Em. God how I missed you. Did you get my letters?"

She nodded, then shook her head. The hair that was tucked behind one of her ears fell across her face. "It's Jean, now. Just Jean."

"Not to me. Never to me. Did you get them?"

"I did."

"Why didn't you write back?"

She shrugged. "I didn't know what to say. You always had the answers, and when you started asking questions, I got scared. If you didn't know, then who did? But you shouldn't have stopped, Davie. I got lost when those letters stopped coming."

All those small words somehow added up to a pain that split me down the middle. I saw Kate's eyes, reflected in the mirror. She flashed me a smile and clapped for the kids and waved them toward the bags and water bottles piled up in a corner.

I wasn't holding Em's hand anymore, and when Kay came into the foyer, she sat right where Emma had been sitting. Right there in that hole. The room still tilted toward her. Toward them both.

That night, I told Kate as much as I could.

When the darkness came, and the streetlights buzzed outside along a street I rarely had the strength to cross, Kate held me and spoke softly into the nape of her neck. I told her about ice creams on summer afternoons, about the smell of wheat in a young girl's hair, about the kisses that had turned into promises I didn't know how to keep. I tried to tell her a few of my becauses, by way of example, but they tasted like ash in my mouth, and I stopped. Simple answers didn't seem enough, anymore. When the tears backed off a bit, Kate asked me a why of her own. Why now?

I didn't answer, and she forced an odd little smile in the dark. I'd seen her give it to parents, when they asked how the lackluster kid was doing. It's the smile your mom wears when she tells you one brand of soda pop is just as good as another, when you know damn well it isn't so. Kate rolled over, but reached back and held my hand. I held hers' right back.

I slept, a little, and when I woke the noise that had dragged me from my slumber was not repeated. I lay on my back, my right hand holding on to Kate's, my left arm limp and asleep and hanging off the bed, knuckles touching the ground.

Cold, familiar fingers with knuckles like loose scrimshaw stretched up from under the bed and held my hand. Emma Jean whispered me a new list of whys, and I squeezed both their hands, determined to hold on as long as I can.
