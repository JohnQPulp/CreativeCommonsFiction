Clint knew better than to argue with Principal Czysky. She peered at him over her tinted and bejeweled glasses, the gold scrollwork glinting as she moved her head through the shadows and light cast on her desk. Clint could never tell what color her eyes were with those glasses, and it unsettled him almost as much as her fuzzy, cat-hair covered sweaters.

Czysky tapped her purple fingernails on the Formica desk and shook her head. Even with such a motion her hair didn't move; it had been Aqua-netted and frosted into a teased helmet of curls that defied any attempt at disarray.

"Let me try this again, Clint. Do you know how many parent complaints I've had this week?" she asked.

Clint didn't know. He shrugged and tried to care.

"Six," finished Czysky, holding up one splayed hand, and then an index finger. Clint sensed an implied middle-finger salute.

"Well," Clint said, pulling on the cuff of his tweed jacket. Although he'd never worn anything like it at Ashuelot Middle School in the Berkshires, where he'd taught for three years after college, he had hoped the more professional appearance might endear him to Czysky and the Board. "You don't think they're just having a difficult time adjusting to a new teacher? I mean, I know Mr. Barnes—"

Czysky narrowed her eyes. "Clinton," she said. Not even his mother had called him Clinton. "Mr. Barnes was adored. You've got big shoes to fill. But Mr. Barnes also didn't tell his sixth grade class that the Civil War had nothing to do with slavery."

"Mrs.—"

"Listen. I don't care what you learned in that hippie liberal shit-hole of a college you went to," she said, leaning over her desk. The braided gold chain she wore on her neck swung forward, its cluster of heart-shaped charms scraping across the desk. "You teach my kids about the slaves, about Harriet Tubman, about the Underground Railroad, and give them some good old fashioned Negro spirituals to learn. 'Follow the Drinking Gourd' is always a good one. That's what Mr. Barnes did, and that's what the parents expect."

"Jesus," Clint said, leaning back in his chair as she leaned forward. "I was just trying to give them another perspective."

"They're in the sixth grade. They only need one perspective. The one in the book."

"My sixth graders at Ashuelot—"

"Your sixth graders were in a middle school," Czysky interrupted. "A drug-infested, liberal, horrifying place where, if I recall, two summers ago three sixth graders committed suicide. We keep our sixth graders here, at Blackfield Elementary, to protect them and prepare them for Blackfield Academy."

Blackfield Academy was the fancy name for the ugly brick building where 7th-12th grade resided, to the tune of 220 souls. Blackfield itself had just under 4,000 residents as it was.

"Yes, ma'am, I understand," Clint said. He only needed to comply. As he spoke the words he heard her relax into her shoulder-pads.

"Still. I'm putting you on probation."

"Probation?" he asked. "From what?"

"I'm requiring you to attend faculty lunches. I expect you to be at lunch every day for the next two weeks. And soccer tryouts are next week."

"Soccer?"

"You said in your application and interview that you were a sports fan."

"Fan being the operative term."

"You'll do fine. They're just kids, after all."

—

Clint knew there was no way in hell he'd seen her before, because a pair of legs like that would never have passed his notice. Not to mention her ass. She was dressed smartly, in a beige suit jacket and matching short skirt; she had a purple scarf tied around her neck, and her corn silk blond hair curled just at the ends.

When she caught his eye, Clint noticed how dark her eyes were.

"Oh, hi," she said, stopping short. She had a brown paper bag in her hand and was, Clint noticed with a grin, heading toward the teacher's lounge. "I'm sorry — I almost walked straight into you."

"No problem," he said. "I'm Clint — Mr. Apwood, by the way. I don't think we've met yet."

"Ah, the new Mr. Barnes," she replied with a smile. Her teeth were not straight, but it was cute. "I'm Emily Stevens. Ms. Stevens. First Grade. I've been away at a conference since of my students is special needs," she said, as politely as she could. "Mrs. Czysky wanted me to get some certification. I went all the way to Boston, and now I'm behind on all my planning, and all I want is a cigarette."

"Don't have any?"

"Trying to quit."

He pulled out his Winstons. "Be my guest. If you want."

Emily lowered her voice, "Oh, shit yes." She took a cigarette and looked left and right. "Want to come with?"

Clint chuckled as he followed Emily through a set of double doors and into a little alcove facing the soccer field; he felt like a rebellious teenager skipping class.

"You said you we're trying to quit," he said, watching her drag lovingly on the cigarette and then let the smoke linger in her mouth before expelling; a seasoned smoker.

"Jesus, if only this were weed," she said, tossing her hair back with the practiced air of a high school cheerleader. She had the build for it.

He couldn't help but laugh this time. "Well, maybe next time."

"Nah, we don't want to incur the wrath of Czysky the Bedazzled Beast."

"Czysky? Yeah, she called my college a shit-hole," Clint said. "And I think she might that the word 'liberal' is a swear."

Emily grinned again, then stubbed out her cigarette with her boot-heel. She wiggled her fingers, and Clint complied, turning over another one without question. The woman had power. He liked it.

"Yeah, but, that's how they are here. They treat anyone who's not geriatric like they're threats because we've got more education between us than half the staff put together. Presuming you have a degree in education?"

"Masters," said Clint, automatically.

"Fancy."

"So how did you end up in Blackfield?"

"I taught in the Berkshires. It wasn't so bad. A little weird at times, but you know."

"I bet it's nowhere near as weird as here," Emily said, shaking her head. She glanced at her watch.

Clint looked across the soccer field to the neat row of houses in the distance. They were all two-story colonials, with closed-in porches, matching siding of varying shades of yellow. Most had contrasting dark shutters in brown. It was warm enough, being September, but the trees were already starting to shift from green to crisp gold and orange.

"Oh, Jesus," Emily said. She wheeled around, throwing her cigarette at the same time. "Walter, what are you doing out here?"

"What is it?" Clint asked, half expecting to see a lumbering boyfriend or incensed groundskeeper.

A little boy stood with his hands over his ears, just a few paces to their right. How he escaped from lunch, he had no idea. Walter was pudgy, wearing a striped shirt and trousers with tennis shoes. His eyes were round, blue or green, but someone had taken care to part his hair just so. It made him look like a middle-aged salesman.

"Walter — you're not supposed to leave lunch," Emily said, walking to him and crouching down, staring into his face.

She sighed, then leaned over and kissed Walter on the cheek. It lasted much longer than Clint wanted it to, and he turned away feeling his stomach squirm.

When he looked back again, Emily was standing, her hand on Walter's head — a protective stance. Everything about her posture and presence had shifted.

The bell rang.

"Well—" Clint started.

"Yes… this is Walter," Emily said. "He's my special boy." She smiled with her lips, and turned to take Walter back to his class.

Clint stood a while, catching his breath, watching his cigarette smolder between his fingers.

—

"Nah, it's nothing serious," Clint said on a call with his brother Wayne. It was late, but Wayne and Vasco were on Pacific time. Clint knew he should be sleeping, but since meeting Emily Stevens, he was restless. "She just bums cigarettes from me at this point."

"That's where it starts," Wayne said, chuckling into the receiver. Clint could hear yapping in the background, and Vasco shouting at the dogs.

Clint stared out across the street from the window at his kitchen table. The streetlight illuminated the jagged shapes of all the shit that the neighbors across the street had dumped into their yard. He had a mind to complain one of these days.

"Knowing you, it'll take a week," Wayne said.

"She's not that kind of girl. I mean, she's very career-oriented."

"So she doesn't fake it like you?"

Clint snorted.

Wayne was giggling. "You're intimidated by her smarts?"

"I just don't know how she can work here. It's a vacuum of closed-mindedness. I just…"

"She's a challenge, you mean," Wayne said. "You've been working on her how long?"

Clint counted back the days. "Eight days, total. Not counting weekends."

"Shit, Clint. Then she's taken. Doesn't mean there's no hope, but just make sure she's not dating a linebacker, okay? I'm not there to prevent you from getting beaten up."

"You never—"

There was a scuffle of dogs, and more screaming from Vasco.

"Shit, I gotta go. Darlene just shit on the carpet." Darlene was the oldest of the dogs, and the matriarch of the pack. "Call you later, bro. Good luck."

Wayne hung up, and Clint continued to look out the window into the darkness. Moths gathered at the streetlight for one of the last times before it got too cold. It was going to start frosting again soon.

—

Clint sat closest to the door at lunch, but he hadn't spotted her yet. It had been three lunches since she had last bummed a cigarette from him, and he had the pack within easy reach of his hands, just so.

Women never unsettled him as she did, but he hadn't been with a woman since Nancy at Ashuelot. Hell, since meeting Emily Clint had started smoking more.

Finally he saw the swoosh of a gray skirt, the edge of her heels, the ends of her hair. She was talking to someone outside of the frame of the door, and let out a forced laugh. Dipping into the doorframe she widened her eyes at him and wiggled her fingers.

When they got outside it was drizzling.

"God, what a day," Emily said, taking the cigarette before Clint had fully extended his arm.

He fumbled for his lighter, and when the cigarette was finally lit she inhaled angrily, half spitting out the smoke.

"You okay?" he asked.

"This fucking school," she hissed, brushing her thin fingers across her brow, pausing a moment to massage the bridge of her nose.

"Hey, I was thinking… wanna go out for a beer after—"

He didn't even get the whole sentence out before she interrupted.

"No," she said, firmly, putting her hand on his wrist. Her fingers were colder than the air. And he'd pissed her off. "It's just no." She ground out the cigarette on the brick, and went back inside.

—

Clint crumpled the essay and closed his eyes. The headache had started an hour ago and, in spite of the ibuprofen and coffee and scotch, had only intensified to the point that the letters on the page were rimmed in red.

More scotch. He'd risk the hangover tomorrow if it meant getting rid of the throbbing in his head.

Glancing out the window he noticed there were no more moths at the streetlight, but there was--

"Well, fuck me," he said.

It was Emily Stevens.

When he came within speaking distance — he had to go around the house to get to the streetlamp as his apartment didn't have street access — she had already started to walk away, her black and white checked scarf fluttering behind her.

"Emily!" he called. "Hey, wait up a sec."

She stopped, her arms flopping down by her side as if in defeat.

"Come on. It's freezing out here."

"I really…" she trailed off, turning around slowly. She looked perfect in the lamplight, her pale hair shot with gold, her lips flushed red. So red.

"I've got nothing to offer you but Sanka, so I won't take it personally if you go somewhere else."

That elicited a sliver of a smile. "Fine. But just for a few minutes. I can't feel my feet."

Clint was painfully aware of the slovenly state of his apartment as he ushered Emily in. He wished he'd at least taken out the garbage. Somehow the pervasive stench of the trashcan was even worse after having been outside in the clean, cold air.

He had to move a stack of papers out of her way to allow enough space for both of them at his kitchen table. And really, table was too kind a word. It was more of an elongated tray that had not seen a dust-rag since he moved in, stuck with bits of crumbs and more than its share of rings from beer bottles.

If she was unsettled, however, she made no indication. Emily tucked her hands under her armpits and waited silently as Clint put the kettle on and rummaged for the sugar. He had a splash of milk left in the jug.

"You take cream or milk or—"

"It's Sanka. It's not like adding stuff to it will improve the taste."

"Yeah. Sorry about that." He leaned back against the counter top, the cool metal edge pressing into his back and through his t-shirt. The whole kitchen was a blue and silver throwback to the 50s and had a certain hermetic charm to it.

He cleared his throat under her stare. She didn't blink much. "You live around here, then?"

"No, not really. Close to the school."

"Oh. Huh. What, um—"

"I was a little rude to you earlier today," she said, folding her hands together.

Clint shrugged, aiming to be casual. But he didn't feel it. He was wound like a top. He hadn't had a girl this close to him in months, and his eyes kept wandering the collar of her sweater, then down further.

"Ah, nothing to worry about." he said, turning to look for a clean mug.

"I just think I might have led you on a bit and I'm sorry. I'm just—"

"In a relationship," Clint replied, enunciating with a pop of the lip. He gave her his most assuring grin. "I get it."

"Been in a long-term relationship before, have you?"

"Nothing to write home about," he said, just as the kettle began to steam. Steam was enough, and a good distraction. "But I've been with someone before who I thought would be," he said.

"True love, then."

"Eh, I don't believe in that. But a good match, the two of us. I would have stuck around if she'd been into that. But she wasn't." Nancy had gotten knocked up and wanted to be rid of it. Clint hadn't agreed. And that had been the end of that.

"Well, it's different with me," said Emily, scooping a heap of Sanka out of the orange-lidded can and swirling it into her cup. "I don't really want to get into it, honestly. I just want to apologize for being terse."

"He have a name?"

"If I tell you his name you'll go looking for him," she said, trying to conceal her smile behind the coffee mug. "I can tell you're that sort. You're jealous already and you haven't even met him."

"He'd kick my ass, huh?"

"He'd wipe the floor with you." She wasn't smiling any longer. "I'm serious, Clint. I don't want to do this whole jealous thing. So we need to stop hanging around at lunch and…"

"It's just cigarettes," Clint said, wishing he hadn't left his pack in the living room. If he went in to get them, it'd give her an excuse to leave. And he wanted at least one chance to get her in bed tonight.

"You know it's not. You asked me on a date."

"Tried to," he corrected.

"Just… let it go, okay?" she said. Her hands were shaking, and she looked away out the window.

"You spend a lot of time with your kids, especially with Walter. Maybe you should—"

"Stop. Now."

"Okay, okay. I'll let it go."

But Clint couldn't. He knew he couldn't, even as he said the words.

—

When November came, so did the rain. One day after class Clint caught a glimpse of Emily talking to a tall, dark-haired man by her car. She drove a maroon '69 Nova, and she always gassed it as the same place on Fridays. He'd learned a lot about her, even at a distance.

But this guy, the one she was talking to, Clint had never seen him before. They boyfriend, at last.

He was broad, all right, but not as built as she had him believe. No linebacker. Maybe he wasn't as tall, but he was fast. If it came down to it, Clint guessed he had the advantage.

The beefcake was older than he would have expected, too. He towered over Emily, and Clint didn't like the way he was looking at her. He was angry, and she was pressed back against the Nova.

While he knew he should keep his distance, Clint felt the familiar tinge of jealousy and a hint a most ancient possessiveness take over.

He had been polite; he had let her go about her business. But not now, not if she was being bullied. He couldn't very well stand for it.

The boyfriend put up a hand and pushed her shoulder back so she stumbled against the car.

Clint sprinted toward them, and he was shouting before he had formulated any cohesive plan.

The man's head snapped up, and Emily shrank back against the car. No emotion registered in her face when she saw Clint. Not anger or surprise; not annoyance or relief. Just nothing.

"What is this, your entourage?" the man asked. He had a subtle Boston accent, and his voice was deep.

"What the hell are you pushing her for?" Clint asked.

"None of your business," the man said. It was surprisingly polite, the way he said it, the words at war with his tone.

"I gather that," Clint said, looking at Emily who immediately dropped his gaze. "You think you're some tough guy, pushing around your girlfriend like that?"

"Clint," said Emily, forcefully. She put her hand on his shoulder and squeezed. It was the most she'd ever touched him, and he shuddered at the tide of lust it prompted in him.

Jesus, if she only knew. Maybe she knew, maybe that was part of it. Maybe she liked what she did to him.

Clint looked at her, and her eyes were dark like wet oak bark. He was going to say something more, but her stare was too intense. He felt the fury drain out of him and he frowned into chin.

"This is Bill; my ex-fiance," she said, gesturing her delicate fingers toward the man. "Bill, this is Clint. A colleague."

The men nodded to each other, and Clint grunted a garbled reply.

Emily rolled her eyes. "Neither of you should be here, so — if you don't mind — I'd like to get home."

Bill had his hands balled into fists. "We were having a conversation," he said, still all politeness in spite of his stance. He looked at Clint, narrowing his eyes. "If you'd excuse us?"

"You pushed her," Clint reminded him. "That's not just a conversation."

"Clint, I can take care of myself," Emily said. She had let go of her hand, but that feeling was now replaced with Clint's own thoughts of her naked, pressed against him. He swallowed. He was starting to hate her for it.

"Can you?" he asked, noting how feeble his own voice sounded.

"Yes," she said. She opened the door of her car and Bill shuffled back, wordless.

"Do you need—"

"I'm fine," Emily said, and shut the door with a clang. "Just leave me alone, for God's sake."

She pulled away, the tires crunching against the rainy gravel.

Bill looked at Clint. "Did you see a kid in there? I swear I saw a kid in there."

"I can't shake her," Clint said, the words escaping him before he could stop them.

Bill sighed. "Yeah. Just wait a while. She'll come around. At least that's what I keep hoping."

—

He waited until winter break. Christmas was the perfect time for casual visits, and so Clint bought a box of chocolates and purchased a little tree for her. He dressed in a wool suit, a thin silk tie, even put in a pin.

Apartment three. Around the back. He went around the corner from the street, clutching the chocolates and the miniature fir tree, his cold breath rising and dissipating about him. Lights were on. The snow crunched underfoot, the only sound in the icy quiet.

Her door had a little placard reading "Home Sweet Home" and a dried berry wreath.

He knocked.

When she answered, he had to hold his breath. She was done up, her makeup more pronounced around the eyes and her lips stained bright red. The shoulder-pads of her fuzzy red sweater gave her a slightly angular look, but the material showed her curves just right.

"Jesus, Clint."

"He's the reason for the season," Clint replied, holding out the chocolates. "Thought I'd bring by a quick present and be on—"

"Ugh, just get in already. It's cold."

She pulled him in by the cuff of his coat, and he staggered to avoid the ice.

"I just wanted to wish you a Merry Christmas."

Emily grabbed the candies and put them on the table. "You're persistent."

"Maybe," he replied, holding out the fir. He had expected her house to be cottage comfort. Instead, it was plain, Spartan. The table was unadorned, stained pine; there was a candle on the table, unlit. Basic white curtains over shades. Linoleum floor, no rug. It smelled like it had been recently sterilized.

Emily's nostrils flared, and for a second he thought she might laugh. But she didn't. "Well, it is Christmas."

"You really want me to go?"

She didn't reply.

"Is he here?" Clint asked. "The boyfriend, I mean."

"Do you have a cigarette?" she asked.

He wanted to argue, but it was too cute. "Of course," he said, feeling for the pack. He had opened a new one, just in case.

She pulled an empty green glass ashtray from her counter and placed it on the table. Clint lit the cigarette for her, and she inhaled softly, savoring it.

"Been a while," she admitted.

"Can I take my coat off?" he asked. The house was heated with forced air, or a wood stove. Or both. He could feel wool prickling at his neck with moisture.

"Sure," she said, holding her hand out. He slipped it off and she hung it over the back of one of her chairs.

Emily smiled wide at him.

"What?" he asked.

"You just didn't give up."

He laughed, suddenly a little self-conscious. "I like you," he admitted. "You're…"

"I didn't think you'd stick around after meeting Bill. He usually scares people off."

She tapped her cigarette in the ashtray then left it there. When she turned to him, she was smiling.

"He is an interesting character," said Clint.

Emily stared at Clint a moment. "You know, he was just by. But he's gone by. He just never could stay away."

"Everything go okay?" asked Clint. "Did he bother you again?"

"He won't be bothering me again, no," Emily said. Then she smiled. "But I don't want to talk about Bill, if it's the same. I'm in a more committed relationship now, as you know."

"I'll have to respect that," said Clint, though he didn't mean it. He couldn't figure her out, and until he did, he couldn't let her go

Emily laughed, a strange nasal chuckle. Then she took a step closer to Clint, tilting her head at him appraisingly. "Except you won't. I've kindly asked, in as many ways possible, but you've persisted."

Clint felt the unfamiliar flush of embarrassment. He had not considered that she knew the lengths to which he'd gone to find out about her. He'd thought he'd outsmarted her.

"It's both creepy and charming," she said, taking another swaying step.

By now Clint's blood was pounding in his ears, a swishing counterpoint to his breath. He was turned on. And he was scared. That was new. Somehow the fear made the closeness of her all the more powerful. She smelled sweet, fresh.

"Do you want it?" Emily asked. It was not delivered with the sweet sibilance of a practiced seductress, but the calm, matter-of-factness of a first grade teacher. "Now that you're here, do you still want it?"

He'd pined for her in ways he didn't even understand. She broke his cool. Emily Stevens was part-siren, part-virgin — this impossible mix that Clint was unable to detangle from his consciousness. He'd never obsessed about women before, he never needed to. There was always someone to move on to.

But not with Emily. Now she was staring at him, challenging him. Teasing him.

"Is your boyfriend home?" Clint asked. He caught something in the air, dusty and slightly acrid. He couldn't place it, but the sweet scent was gone.

There was a creak from the other room, the buzz of something electrical.

"Does it matter?" she asked.

Emily pressed up against him, sliding up his chest and into that kiss he'd been waiting for. He moaned against her mouth, warm and wanting. She was far from shy, gently slipping her tongue into his mouth and running her hands down the sides of his face, then up into his hair. He felt his skin tingle, then crawl, like someone was pulling gauze over him.

He shivered and pulled away, licking his lips.

They were numb.

Clint's legs were weak, and he staggered back, falling into the chair.

"I was hoping to get you to the bed, but the chair will do just fine," Emily said, stepping back.

"Sounds good to me…"

He felt his throat go thick, like he'd just downed some Novocain. His muscles were sluggish, moving toward rigidity. Had she stuck him with something? Clint's thoughts were muddy, but the overpowering sense of lust was still there. He still wanted her, even more than before.

Watching with heavy lids, Clint saw Emily lean her head back and insert two fingers into her thick-lipped mouth. She pulled what looked like gum out, stretching it, and kept pulling. A long strand followed, slick and sticky.

And more, and more.

"You still want me now," she said, coughing slightly as she pulled the string from her mouth and then bit it with her teeth. "More than even before, don't you?"

He would have nodded, if he had remembered how.

Strand after strand of silvery web, she pulled from her throat and wrapped around him, tightening, always tightening, with her long-fingered hands. Sweat beaded on her brow, and she pulled down the collar of her sweater, smiling sweetly at him, almost self-consciously. She panted with the effort of securing him.

And he wanted it. He wanted more of it.

"Soon enough," Emily said, as if she could hear his thoughts.

"Is it ready? I'm hungry again."

The voice came from the door and Clint watched as Walter came into view. His cheeks were flushed, and when he smiled, Clint saw his teeth were streaked with blood.

"He's just slowing now," Emily said smoothly, running her hands over Clint's brow as his vision began to darken. "I'll let you know when it's your turn, love."

Then she turned to Clint and kissed him on the mouth. When she pulled away her smile was full of black webs and whispers.
