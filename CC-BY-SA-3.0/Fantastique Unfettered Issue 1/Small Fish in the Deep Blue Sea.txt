"One doesn't discover new lands without consenting to lose sight of the shore for a very long time."
	—Andre Gide

Harold figures I get a kick out of his emulated voices. The way he snaps shut the glassy membranes on his bug-out eyes and does a full-on boogie-woogie till his voice is new and he's a changed man. Whichever stereotypical recording he chooses hums through grates hugging the cartilage above his gills. He has a detachable emulator — very snazzy — so he can still use his true voice, but I haven't heard that pretty, waterlogged gurgle in months. Not since Sally broke our barroom pact and swooped on a Surfacer.

His affected cowboy drawl made me blush the first day I met him, and that's why he changes the way he talks now when he has something unpleasant to say. He's a showman, Harold. Always acting. Delivering bad news in a chocolate-sweet comedy coating. Laying it on thick so as not to upset me.

Clever guy.

—

Sally and I first met Harold at the oxygen bar where we worked, a lime-green plywood joint on the water's edge called The Topside. Fresh Surfacers often turn up at the bar just after they've washed up at Beachhead. That's because Surfacers have a hard time adjusting to topside air from the pure stuff down below, and we're the only oxygen bar within walking distance without a No Surfacers sign dangling on the door. The bar also gets a lot of snowbirds shirking their wives, owing to the fact that The Topside is a topless bar. A breath of fresh air, indeed.

It was deep into summer and the bay air steamrolled into the city, making everyone's vision hazy. The heat turned us Topsiders into thirsty, landlocked mer-creatures. I was breathless, swimming in my own sweat, yanking my collar when Harold showed up looking for a job. He wore black flannel and jeans, cowboy boots — spurs and all — and a red handkerchief below a ten-gallon hat, like he was an outlaw and the bar was a one-horse saloon in the badlands.

He'd found the getup in the secondhand bin the Red Cross set out for Surfacers, the place where Cape Town residents drop their Halloween costumes and other oddities they'll never wear again. A Department of Homeland Security work order shook in his hands. DHS gives every fresh Surfacer a form requiring local businesses to hire them, a free pass for the first entry-level Help Wanted sign, and we really needed a dishwasher.

Obviously, Harold hadn't emerged from the water too long ago. He was still lugging around the nylon backpack stuffed with newbie gear, courtesy of the United Way: terrycloth towel, sleeping mat, needle and thread, water canteen, kenetic flashlight, rain poncho, a week's worth of MREs, and an Army survival guide translated into the Surfacer language.

He had the same look as all fresh Surfacers. His mercury-colored eyes were the size of plums, each roaming on its own investigative track. He had a gumshoe demeanor, walking with an amateur P.I. swagger, as though he didn't want to touch the bar scene for fear of contaminating it. He extended his booted feet straight out, one in front of the other, so he touched land dead center of the tiles, as if walking a drunk man's line on a freshly mopped floor. Limbs new to gravity, he extended his arms like airplane wings to steady himself.

Sally was doing her usual routine, chicken dancing barefoot on customer's tables, flapping her bent arms, her little breasts bouncing, red vellum cape around her shoulders, reflective aviator goggles socketed over her eyes. Her dead and stuffed parrot, Daniel Boone, hung from her tartan skirt by a safety pin. Customers threw down extra dollars to watch her squish her petite feet into seafood platters, mash crab and cod between her toes, and kick untouched coleslaw and baked beans behind her as she pretended to scratch for seed.

"Fly away, Daniel Boone," Sally yelled, flinging the dead bird across the room, straight toward trembling Harold. The parrot whopped him in his slack-jawed face, and he fumbled like he'd received a long football pass, then recovered the parrot with his free hand before it touched the floor. As Harold walked the bird back to Sally, she adjusted her goggles, snapped the cape taut to her backside, and launched from the table, yelling: "Fly! Fly away!"

But Harold was smooth. He dropped the parrot and scooted under her before anyone could blink. Sally swooned in his arms, then he sank to one knee.

"Thank you, my good man," Sally said. "These wings have given me problems all week."

"Boy-howdy, I'd better rustle me up some oxygen," Harold said. "It's gettin' mighty hard to breathe." He'd chosen Wild Jack Texan as his emulator voice. DHS gives an emulator to every fresh Surfacer, a two-way vocal translator, and most Surfacers donate theirs back once they can speak English without them. The voice sounded patched and far off, as if the original words had been recorded through dust clouds at a rodeo.

Sally whispered in his ear, then led him by the hand down the hallway to her dressing room. After a quick pit-stop to open a new can of clam chowder, I started for Sally's room to see if I could pry Harold from her clutches.

When I opened her door, she was lounging on her vanity, wrapped in a purple-feathered scarf, holding a box of oyster crackers. Harold squatted below her, fish lips open. Sally's legs straddled Harold's shoulders, wiggling her pink toes. As they giggled, Sally propped a cracker on her thumb as if preparing to do a coin toss, then thumped it into Harold's slap-slapping jaws. He masticated and swallowed in a gullet-grunting gulp, big fish eyes ogling Sally's skinny frame.

Sally, a red-faced tease, tossed her hair over her shoulder. When I removed Sally's feet from Harold's neck by her toes, she pouted.

"Whoa-howdy," Harold said, blending the two words into one.

"Partner, am I glad I found you," I said, mimicking his accent. His wandering eyes zeroed in on me. "I have the perfect place for you. Ever washed dishes?" I pulled him up and put my arm around his spongy neck.

He told me he was still refugeeing at Beachhead. That's when I asked him to move into the rental camper with me.

—

Harold and I are spending Independence Day fishing at Crocodile Rock when the sailboat carrying our dreams swims by. We sit on my pickup's tailgate, watching the waves slosh against its gold-lettered hull: The Lady Bellipotent.

Fireworks burst over the brackish water and sparkle against the diamond-shaped scales on Harold's face, crowns of rainbow tones glimmering down his back. He reclines, his slick elbows squeaking on the tailgate. "I'm a-thinkin' Sally has taken a real shining to me," he says, adjusting the glow-in-the-dark snorkel mask he found in the Red Cross bin. Made for humans, it doesn't fit right on his flat head.

His fish lips smack like flat tires. We smell fish frying, and we lift our noses higher, heaving breaths like Harold when he couldn't get enough air, back when he was still using oxygen tanks. He's foaming, thrumming his gullet. Drool drops onto his muscle shirt, forming a sort of saliva bib.

"Of course she's taking a linking to you. Everybody likes you at work. You're a fine dishwasher," I say.

"You ain't getting' it, partner. I mean she likes me."

The sailboat drifts closer, weaving between trash gondolas that waft toward the channel where the bay meets the open sea. The bay became Cape Town's refuse dump after the only landfill on the peninsula overflowed five years ago — roughly the same point when Surfacers began washing up at Beachhead. On one of the floating heaps, a seagull is trapped in a six-pack ringer, wings seizing behind its back.

"I want her," Harold says, looking out to sea.

"Yes. We need one," I say.

The canvas sails bubble and ripple. On the deck, a man ties mast ropes into pretzel knots, careful not to snag the deep-sea fishing gear. The man's family hangs out below deck, visible through large octagonal port windows. His wife fries their catch while their two boys laugh at cartoons playing on a travel-sized television set. The woman cuts onions, and I almost cry. When she cornmeal-batters the onion rings and drops them into the oil, my stomach growls. I want what that man has. I want to go on a sailboat, and I want fried fish and onion rings for my last meal.

Harold's cheeks inflate, and I imagine the possibilities. I think about how we would go far south, down to the tip of Argentina. Harold and I will knock around a Latin dance club where Argentinean women bounce in colorful bikinis and smooth men jive and spin in oxhide wingtips. We'll dance all night, then bring the rumpus back to the boat. I wonder if we'll ever sleep.

I say to Harold, "You ever been to Argentina?" I take a swig of Pacifico, then Harold breaks the news:

"Sally asked me to go to Buttress Point to see the barges."

I miss my mouth, sloshing lukewarm beer down my neck. It suctions my shirt to my chest. "We can build one," I say, pointing to the sailboat. "That life, my friend, is ours for the taking." I fan my shirttail from my gut.

"Well-sir, don't rightly know 'bout that. I says to Sally that we can mosey over to the Point, but she has to know I'm riding off into the sunset real soon. Darlin', I says, I'm goin' home." He locks eyes with me. "I'm blowin' this here town."

"Sounds like a plan." I jostle a soda bottle with my bare foot. "We can build a smaller version with just enough room for the two of us, using this stuff. There's plenty of rubbish out here. We'll string plastic bottles together, to make the hull. Just us, you and me." I sweep my hand over the hundreds of bottles and scraps of cotton twine and broken wakeboards and flattened floats littering the shore.

"It's a whole lotta commitment, Stanley. Ya know?"

"Maybe so, but you've gotta admit we can build something that'll float out of this junk. Our very own design. A trashboat. That old tarpaulin over there will work as a sail." The tarp, once used for weatherproofing after the last hurricane, lay half buried in a sand dune. "What do you say?"

"Sally says we're all tryin' to find home."

The boat floats out of view, its image fresh in my mind.

Harold breaks the silence. "Where is Buttress Point, anywho?"

Couples go to Buttress Point to feel their way around each other's bodies while barges feel their way out to the ocean. The place has a long history of backseat sex, starting back when poodle-skirted girls and pomade-slick dudes bopped over there to ditch Mom and Pop. I imagine Harold and Sally in the backseat of her Ford Galaxie. Two people and a street-block-long jalopy like that parked at Buttress Point would make for a wild time.

"Buttress Point is nowhere you need to know about," I pull apart my fishing rod and pack it away. "I'm ready to go home." I toss Harold the keys. "I smell like booze. You drive, Lover Boy."

—

After we get home from work and I've packed Harold's sardine lunch for the next day, we lie in our beds, Harold on the foldout cot and me on the blow-up floor mattress. Twenty years old, the camper smells like the inside of an old man's suit jacket. The stench bothers Harold, so I sing a lullaby to help him sleep:

"I want to be way out in the deep blue sea—"

Harold rolls over and drops his speckled arm in front of my face. "Tell me why you left Florida, Stanley." His emulator voice mimics Cary Grant as Rhett Butler.

"Why do you want to know about Florida? I hate Florida."

"You got a momma back there missing your smiling face, doll?"

"Sure, something like that," I say. "It's been a few years, you know? Since I've been home."

His eyelids flick, and flick again, in split-second stop motions, like in an animation flip-book. "Trouble on the farm?"

I exhale a small, shameful laugh. "You could say that. I got a lot of flack back there. Retirees didn't accept my lifestyle."

"That why you wanna be a sailboat captain?"

"I gotta get outta this shoebox." I try to touch his hand, but he moves it. "My parents lived in a suburban box where all the streets ended at squared angles, the houses like doll houses, Easter egg colors. Mom was a secretary, and Dad was a banker. Mom crocheted dolls, and Dad made me play baseball like the other boys. One time, I came home from practice with a black eye. They asked what happened, and I told them I kissed Ronnie Mills in the dugout. The first thing Mom said was, 'All the other mothers on the block will get to be grandmothers.' Dad strong-armed me into adjustment counseling. So I took off."

"Cast out like Eve in an orchard."

"What about you?" I ask. "Why'd you surface?"

Harold stays silent for a long time. I've almost fallen asleep by the time he speaks again.

"Don't know. But I'm gonna find me a new place, a real sweet spot out in the wide blue sea. That's what I do know. It's home, Stanley, like nowheres else in this here world."

I spring up. "That's a yes on the boat?"

"Sail away, O Captain, my Captain."

—

"We'll find our own sea garden," I say.

It's four a.m. when Sally and Harold crunch down the shell driveway, coming from their date at Buttress Point. I'm sitting on the plastic row seat in the camper's tiny living room, arranging magnetic letters on the cardboard Kenny Rogers cutout Harold and I stole from Kenny Rogers' Roasters after the chain closed shop in Cape Town. Kenny has a speech bubble over his guitar that once said something positive about fried chicken. We've covered the bubble in magnetic weather-stripping so we can write notes. Practical things: BUY MILK, NEED EGGS, or I HATE MY LIFE.

I've tossed and turned tonight with fervid dreams of Harold and Sally making love in the backseat of her Galaxie, their naked bodies sticking to the vinyl seats. To keep my mind occupied, I write a special message to Harold. We're missing the Os in our alphabet, so it reads: I LUV U.

Headlights streak across the oval windows. I hear the car door thunk shut, then the creak of our porch milk crates when they sit on them. I lean against the door, bulging the aluminum at the bottom, and listen. Harold's detached his emulator. I haven't heard his true voice in so long that I barely recognize it.

"It was the skull barrels. They fell on our patch of ocean floor. Barrel rain, every day, landing in our hunting grounds, in the seaweed gardens where we speared the big fish," Harold gurgles.

"Radioactive barrels," Sally whispers.

"Papa and me were hunting sharks when I tripped on a barrel and sucked the sludge into my gills. I remember Papa's roar. He dropped his spear and swept me up in his arms, but it was too late."

"Too late. Too late."

I hate the way Sally repeats things like a parakeet.

"I started changing, began to float. Papa tied me up with sea vines and weighed me down with rocks. I remember Papa waist deep in seaweed, tossing vines to me as I finally floated up and away. The ocean floor dimmed, and he became smaller and smaller in my view."

"Oh, poor Harold," Sally says, followed by the sandpaper scratching of her fingernails on his scales.

Harold begins to sing in a quivering boyish voice: "I want to be."

Sally joins him. "Way out in."

"The deep blue sea."

"With you," they sing in harmony.

I change the message on Kenny's speech bubble. Then I go to our room, cradle my Bette Midler from Hocus Pocus plush doll. As I fall asleep, I think about what I wrote to Harold:

LUV U MAN.

—

Two hours later, I wake to the smell of eggs frying and the toady voice of Louis Armstrong along with his gurgling trumpet. I snatch open the orange shower curtain partitioning our room. Sally and Harold are jitterbugging to the music pouring from a wind-up weather radio, all elbows, scissoring arms, kicking heels, wagging fingers.

As the radio winds down, Harold notices me. Sally darts to the stove and flips a sizzling omelet. They stare at me and I stare at them, until Sally breaks the standoff.

"Would you like some breakfast, Stanley?"

I don't answer. Instead, I scoot to the mini-fridge, shooting Harold the narrow-eye. I peek inside our brown-bag lunches. Sally has replaced Harold's sardines with three hard-boiled eggs.

A new threshold of annoying.

"You must be hungry," Sally mumbles, her mouth full.

Harold drops to his knees as Sally sits, then leans with his elbows between her thighs, his jaws open expectantly. Her mouth wide over his, their lips nearly locking, she drops the chewed-up bite into his mouth. He guzzles it down like a milkshake.

"He likes sardines," I say.

"He digests eggs easier." Sally wipes her chin. "Care for an omelet?"

The Kenny Rogers cutout stands awkwardly beside them. His message has been revised:

LUV U SALLY.

"I've lost my appetite," I say.

—

I feel detached in the oil rigs' glow. The lights streak the night in confetti colors. I work alone on the trashboat at our secluded building spot among Crocodile Rock's limestone crags, where stone meets sea in violent triangles jutting from the sand. Because of the stones, swimmers don't come to this side of the Rock — only lonely fishermen, grandfathers without grandsons to share the thrill of the catch.

I'm twining soda bottles together in convex lines, beginning the hull. Harold stands in the current in rolled-up chinos, seaweed-stuck and wobbly, holding his fishing pole like an overprotective lover. He watches the far-away columns of light coming from Beachhead, DHS flashlights sweeping the shoreline for fresh Surfacers. Shrimp boats drag their nets in the eerie black-green bay, bringing in loads of mullet and fat gray shrimp.

Harold hasn't helped with the boat today. Instead, he's spent the day reeling in fish and storing them in the cooler on my pickup parked at the rock line. I suspect it's because Sally is with us. Each time he brings fish to put on ice, he can talk to her while still looking busy. We've made a deal that she can crash our boat-building Saturdays so long as she stays on the pickup bed and doesn't touch the boat. She's been smacking on the sardines I packed for Harold, piling a molehill of cans in my truck bed.

The wind tumbles my bottles into a rock crevice. Reaching for them, I glance back at the truck. Sally stands on the tailgate in her tuxedo-print swimsuit, her rust-browned arms wide. Her cape glimmers purple and red from the rig lights blinking like minor planets. With those colors spotlighting her, she looks like a second-string superhero, her arms too small for her short body.

She tiptoes, then jumps from the tailgate. "To the moon!"

For a second, she seems to hover, flapping, snapping her cape, before thudding into the stones. She cracks her skull on one and lies limp, blood on her forehead.

Harold drops his fishing pole and sloshes her way while I navigate the rocks. He reaches her first.

"My wings ain't what they used to be," she says to Harold as he wipes blood from her eyelid.

Harold scoops her up, carries her to the pickup, and lays her delicately in the seat. "You're crazy as a canary toying with a cat. You know that?" he says, mimicking Humphrey Bogart, wet fingers nudging her chin. "Don't you worry, little one. Someday those wings will carry you away."

I run into the surf, pick up Harold's fishing pole and reel in. It whips hard, the rod severely arching, but the bite's gone, the fish bored of the game. Watching the lovebirds, I wish that I had never met Harold, and that Sally would tumble off a condominium balcony into the sea.

—

We share the bathroom every morning, the miniature linoleum floor our intimate piece of land, the tub water Harold's pretend ocean. He stretches out his arms like ship masts, and the eggshell wall tiles look like starched sails.

I'm grooming in front of the miniature sink in my silk banana boxers as he sinks down, his shoulders flounder-flat in the shallow tub. He sloshes up, and his eye membranes slide open. He looks surprised by his own wetness. His naked, muscular frame resembles that of a dragon.

"Yo, guy," he says.

His voice is not his own, and I know something is up: he's acting again. He has never called me guy before. It makes me feel anonymous, unspectacular, as though I'm just another man who's reached a dead-end in the minimum-wage maze. I have to go to work this afternoon. I want to pinch myself, wake up, and realize I've been trapped in someone else's life for forty-two years.

I suddenly feel naked, lines of myself in the double mirrors — one before and behind me — my bald head telescoping light from the bare overhead bulb down the three-dimensional mirror corridor. I poke my belly flab, pull my skin as if it were a rubber suit and let go. The skin slinks back.

Harold lists in the water, watching me with a bulbous left eye. It looks as though he is rising and my wrinkled, prickled self is receding, exponentially reflected into smaller and smaller images.

I plunk my toothbrush into my mouth. I have this thing about clean teeth.

"Yo, guy," he says again. "You in there, buddy-boy?"

"Yeah, I'm with you," I slur between brushstrokes.

"O-right. Tell you what we should do, big man…"

Old-school greaser. I've had a hard time placing his accent.

Harold bubbles his stomach and contracts his pelvis, preparing to disappear beneath the surface. He's been perfecting this disappearing act for months. Like an Olympic diver, he performs a nightly routine, training himself to stay under for longer periods of time, attempting to use his gills to glean oxygen from the water molecules.

Reverse engineering himself.

His gills tremble. "Tell ya what, let's you and me add a third seat in the boat."

I cut my gum with the toothbrush. The blood between my teeth tastes like pennies.

"What for?"

"Sally. Duh."

"Nope, won't work. Sally can't even swim. Birds don't swim."

"Ducks swim. And swans. You's forgettin' swans, guy."

"Sally's not a duck, Harold. She's too skinny. Ducks are plump. They have meat on their bones. And she sure as hell ain't a swan. More of a finch. Nothing special on the eyes and jumping with energy, which is nice, sure, till you wanna sleep or read or philosophize — things that require peace and quiet. You ever wanna sleep again, Harold?"

"Well, I think she's a swan." Harold sucks a mouthful of air, slides under and curls like a seahorse. I'm halfway through shaving by the time he pops up, gagging. He drops back and strokes the faucet with his webbed toes, and I look into the hallway reflection of my pudgy frame. The half of my beard still on my face is gray, and my chest droops in a flattened balloon shape. I see only myself repeating on and on, a singular, lonely decimal.

"I think she's probably on something," I say.

He starts and stops, cocks his head, starts again, "Anyways, it don't matter whether she can swim. She's gonna be on the boat. Get me?"

"No, she isn't. We can't spare the room. Small as she is, she'll still add weight. Too much weight will slow us down."

"You in a hurry to get rid of me, Sweet Cheeks?"

I drag the razor down my face. I'm nervous and aggravated and trembling. I nick my chin. My blood dots into the sink like an abstract pointillist painting. "Also, you may not have noticed, but it's kind of our thing," I say. "Our escape…to our sea garden, remember?"

"We're blowing this Popsicle stand either way, my man. What difference does it make who rides shotgun?"

"It matters that it's you and me. You and me matter."

"Sally matters."

Feeling like a bully, I dab on mango moisturizer. The cream's menthol effervescence tingles, and I try to forget about Harold and Sally.

"She's my main squeeze," Harold says, patting his hand on the water. "You'll understand when you get your own swan, Stan."

"If she's such a swan, why doesn't she just fly away?"

Harold stares at me in silence. Water beads on his scales. "If you're a swan, you've got options," he says. He splashes down, kicks around a bit, sloshing water onto the whale-shaped rug. He winds his fingers with the grace of an angelfish, like he's zigzagging under the sea.

Only after I've gone to work does he surface.

—

The next morning, when I arrive at Crocodile Rock, soda bottles surround our trashboat in haphazard piles. The boat lies in two pieces, separated by a gulf of sand. Harold squats in the middle, looking smooth in a tropical button-up and flip-flops, sawing with a rusted multi-tool the twine I had so rigorously tied into Boy Scout knots. He blows fat soap bubbles from his snorkel, and Sally pecks them as they float by her face.

I plunge my hands into my drifter jacket. The sight of the boat in pieces makes me want to cry, or punch someone. Or both.

"Wazzup, Bro," Harold says as I trod up, kicking sand into his work area. "Gnarly day, eh?"

Dammit. He's emulating Hang Ten Ted.

I feel lightheaded, shaky. "What do you think you're doing?"

"Oh, this? Bro, I'm making the adjustments I talked with ya about. Remember?"

"Yeah, I remember. I remember that I said it wasn't happening."

"But it is happening. I'm doin' it now, big guy."

I knead my forehead with my palms.

Sally's sandals weight down a swatch of butcher paper on which Harold and I had drawn boat sketches. Harold has traced over our pencil lines with permanent marker, drafting the boat four feet longer with a third seat, repositioning the sail closer to the stern. Sally's sunflower seed hulls speckle the paper.

Harold's also drawn stick figures in the new boat design. The first figure has a fish head, ME scrawled in crooked letters above it. The second has a triangle dress, sinusoidal cape, and SALLY written with a backward S. At the rudder, Harold has drawn an elementary-simple figure, labeled STANLEY in nervous script.

Most infuriating: Harold's new design looks like it'll work. In fact, due to the length and broader body, it appears more stable than our first draft.

"It's happening? Oh, it's happening, is it?" I snort, snatching the paper, waving it wildly. "Like hell it is!"

Sally squawks, hopping stones in vicious circles.

I tear the paper into fours, crumple and throw the pieces at Harold, causing him to drop the multi-tool.

"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Chill out, dude."

"Chill out?" I snort. "You bastard. You aren't changing our project, our lives for this…this floozy."

"Bro-man, that's totally uncool. Don't talk about my chickadee that way."

"Screw you, Harold."

He turns four shades of green. "Look-a-here, you're my main man. But I'm still adding a seat for my sweet bun. We're gonna be together, and you're gonna have to deal with that, bro." Pre-recorded waves behind his emulator's voice echo the real waves pounding behind him. "We got somethin' we want to tell you. Right, babycakes?" Harold grabs Sally mid-jump and drags his translucent lips across her cheek.

"Drop the damn teenager act, Harold, and tell me like a man."

Harold detaches his emulator. "Stanley," he gurgles, "Sally and I have decided to get married."

Sally love-pecks Harold's sandy gills. "You bet we have, Snookums!"

I lose it. I dive into the sand, steal the multi-tool, and run the outside of the boat, stabbing and slashing twine, snagging the blade on plastic. I pull the bottles free and sling them at Harold and Sally.

"Dude!" Harold yells, emulator back on. "Stop it."

I stab the bottles, pushing the blade in and pulling it out with exaltation, squeaking plastic. A mad rush of adrenalin, and it feels good. "Find your sweet spot now, lovebirds." I spit the words.

Harold tackles me, and we fall backward. My back crunches into stone, and we roll. His sticky fingers grip my arm, his scales rubbing my skin raw as he grapples for the multi-tool. We tumble on the stones, into the surf. Waves thrash my face as Harold straddles me and beats my arm against the sand until I drop the tool into the current and it's sucked into the bay. I shimmy my legs under Harold and thrust out. He lands in dry sand and scurries into Sally's waiting arms. She covers him in her cape, flashes her white-wide eyes and hisses.

"You," I gasp, dripping, trembling cold. "You two want each other so bad. Fine. Just fine. Fly away together. Little birdie can take you on her wings — if she ever gets off the ground. I'm done with both of you."

—

The pickup's squealing tires coalesce my thoughts, and I go home and sleep harder than I have my entire life, making up for my last few weeks of sleeplessness over Harold. When I wake, I pad into the living room. Kenny Rogers has a brightly colored message:

CAST UFF @ 5 PM

I scan the camper. Harold's things are missing. His poster of six-shooter John Wayne. His Sean-Connery-as-James Bond figurines. His gold-framed picture of James Dean with feathered hair. His pre-owned VHS collection. His autographed amateur boxing gloves.

The clock on the coffeemaker glares four p.m. I hightail it to Crocodile Rock.

The sun drops low, and a backwash of fog hangs low on the bay, soon to swallow Cape Town. In the changing light, I see the boat at the water's edge, as if it's wandered in on its own.

At the sight, I trip on my own feet. Curious whirls of sand kick up around the bottles whose red labels flap in the moist breeze, miniature flags. I blink, wipe sand from my face, and blink again. Harold and Sally have completed the boat.

Inside the walled deck, they've constructed a sleeping overhang of broken surfboards, lashed with nylon rope. A PVC mast branches at forty-degrees, the blue tarpaulin bulking and shaking eagerly, a flying fish with multicolored wings spray-painted on it. Graffitied on the back is Lady Olivia. My mother's name. Just as Harold and I had planned.

I could kiss Harold, I love him so much.

The deck teems with Harold's Red Cross gear, along with hundreds of canned goods — enough to sustain a man for several weeks at sea. Scuba flippers line the inside deck, and on them alphabet magnets spell another message:

SAIL AWAY CAPT STAN

I gaze at the blanketed water. Harold's head bobs far out, his hand waving in long arches, nearly indistinguishable from the blue-gray water.

I shove off.

Harold swims some distance ahead, and I follow. The boat lifts on the waves, dips and rises, the design as impressive a thing as we planned. The sail spins, catches wind, then whips taut. I steer the rudder oar. I move with the boat and the boat moves with me.

The full moon looks like a giant amber-orange bubble ready to burst, so full with the sun's light. A harvest moon in an ocean of water-colored fog. I stretch my arms as I float under the bay bridge. I have never felt so new. I lean back to see the bright red arches.

I see Sally.

Fog spins on the bridge, as if holding her up. She's flatfooted outside the pedestrian guardrail, in tights and cape, aviator goggles rubber-banded to her face. Headlights blink and horns beep faintly. I start to cry. I can't help it, and I scream her name. She can't hear me. I watch because I can do nothing but watch. The current keeps Harold moving, his head craning to see her so high above.

She jumps. The wind carries her down. She falls, falls so far, the cape pinched between her fingers. Her arms reach like wings. Her tiny body plummets headfirst toward the water.

Then, she's up. She soars on a funnel of fast-moving air. The wind bubbles the cape, and she flutters her arms, a new bird in flight. She rises higher, nose up, mouth open, hair bristling like feathers.

Harold waves to me as Sally cruises over him. I wave back as he splashes on, headed for deeper water where the bay feeds into the ocean. Sally's shadow follows him. He watches her a long time, then drops under. She circles off toward the purple horizon. I coast behind, heading east, every exhilarating rise and melancholy fall moving us on our own currents, between water and wind.
