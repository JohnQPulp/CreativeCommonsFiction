"Hey, mister!"

Alfred paused in the act of stepping off the curb, then continued across Queen Street. Halfway across, he heard light footsteps catching him up. A hand slipped around his elbow, and the little hooker – she barely came up to his shoulder – fell into step with him.

"I'll give you a blow job for those leaves in your hat."

"Don't jerk with me," he said. "I'm not in the mood." He lengthened his stride, but her shoes tippy-tapped faster and she kept up somehow.

"Please," she said, and her hand tightened. He took the curb and turned sharply away down Bathurst, jerking his arm. He heard her stumble, her sharp "Ow!" and the blare of a horn.

Shit! He didn't want her run over. He turned around, but she had already made it to the sidewalk, back on her feet. Her black fishnet hose had torn over one knee. Under the streetlight and the neon glare of the pizza place he saw a waif of a girl with long, fair hair, a skirt hardly worth the name, cheap strappy heels that should by rights be giving her a nosebleed. Her mascara would have done justice to a raccoon. She was way too young to be out on the street, offering blow jobs to middle-aged men. All around them cars zipped through the intersection and people walked or biked by; for all the attention they paid her, fifteen-year-old prostitutes narrowly missed death at Queen and Bathurst all the time.

"You okay, honey?" He peered down into her face. She nodded and wiped her eyes with the back of her hand, leaving two sideways smears. She took a breath and looked at his hat again, and the wilted little spray of oak leaves he'd impulsively picked that morning before he left Algonquin Park.

"I wasn't jerking with you, mister. I mean it – best blow job you ever had, too, or double your leaves back." She gave him a one-sided smile and he chuckled and picked the spray out of his hatband.

"I don't do sex with kids," he said, "but tell you what, I'll buy you a coffee and a donut at Tim's there, and give you the leaves, if you tell me about it. You look like you could use a sit-down. Deal?"

"You're not one of those rescuers?" she said, "Trying to get me off the street?"

On impulse he tore two leaves off their twig and held them out to her.

"Look, two now, the other three when you've told me the story, okay? They'll kick us out of Tim's in twenty minutes anyway, so - "

—

She slid into the booth across from him.

"That's better," he said, and pushed her plate – two jelly donuts - encouragingly towards her. She'd washed her makeup off while he ordered; without it she looked younger, and also more serious. Her hazel eyes flashed green. She finished her first donut in thirty seconds and took a gulp of the hot chocolate she'd asked for.

"Ready to tell me?" he asked.

"Sure. You're not going to believe it, though."

"Well, you know, selling stories is a little bit like selling sex. It doesn't have to be real, it just has to be good enough to entertain them, fool them, just for the moment, right? Make it good enough, I'll believe it, just for now. Maybe even in the morning."

She chewed her lip, considering.

"All right," she said, "I'm a changeling. Do you know what that is?"

He shook his head.

"The elves leave one of their babies in place of a human one. I was left for a human. I'm going home to my real people, the elves." She paused.

"Go on."

"Changelings mostly didn't survive," she said, "The stories say they sickened and died. The ones that didn't, people used to find out what they were and kill them. But now, if your kid's sick, you take them to the doctor, maybe a specialist. I spent a lot of time sick in bed, but I didn't die. Then when I - " she glanced sideways.

An embarrassed hooker, he thought, who'd believe it? Aloud he said, "You hit puberty?"

"Yeah. I began to hear them – elves – calling me. In school, on the bus, everywhere. I didn't tell anybody. They'd lock me up. And then some things, metal and stuff, started to hurt me, just touching it. I hear plants, too. The little trees in those planters? They can't reach the earth, and they cry all the time. I have to leave."

"So where are you going?" he asked.

"I didn't know until tonight," she said. "I saw those leaves, and I knew they came from my home. Where did you get them?"

"Algonquin Park. I go camping up there a couple of times every year."

"Can I get a bus to there?"

"Close – there's a little place called Maynooth right nearby. You can get a shuttle to the park from there."

"To where you got those leaves. That's my home; I knew when I saw them."

"Algonquin Park. It's up north. I go camping there twice a year."

"Can I get a bus there?"

"Sure. But – what about your parents?"

She touched his wrist. "Where did you say you got these?"

He opened his mouth, and thought, Algonquin Park. But that couldn't be right. There was no such place.

She touched his wrist again.

"See?" she said, "Algonquin Park. It's real. My parents won't even remember me."

"How did you do that?"

She shrugged, all adolescent for a moment.

"I dunno. I just can. Look at this!" She took the two leaves from her little purse and laid them side by side on the table, then smoothed one with her hand. It crinkled and fluttered; in its place a fifty-dollar bill settled onto the white Formica, hologram shimmering. Alfred picked it up, felt the engraving.

"If you can do that with leaves, why are you hooking?" he asked.

"The leaves here – they're poisoned or something. They'll turn, but then they crumble up and blow away. These will last until sunrise. I need to get my ticket tonight."

Alfred took the three remaining leaves out of his hat and passed them over to her.

"Do it again," he said, laying his arm along the side of the table to shield the leaves. She smiled and spread the leaves out, and again he watched that flutter-and-crinkle.

"I gotta go," she said. She folded the fifties into her purse and ate the remaining jelly donut in three bites.

"Is that enough money?" he asked.

"I've got some, cash, too."

"So no more blow jobs for strange men."

"No. No more. I – I can't say the usual words, you know? We can't. But I owe you."

"Not at all. You sold me a helluva story. Maybe I'll see you in Algonquin Park."

"Maybe." She smiled and stood, then leaned down and kissed his cheek. Through the window Alfred watched her walk away toward Bay and the bus station; the light at Queen and Bathurst turned as she reached it, and she never broke stride

Are there others like her? he wondered. In the dregs of his coffee he saw his future, cruising Queen Street with oak leaves in his hat, rescuing elfin hookers.
