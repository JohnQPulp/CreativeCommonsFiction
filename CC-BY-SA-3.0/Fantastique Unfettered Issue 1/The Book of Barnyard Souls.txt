"Can you count them, Kalee?"

She nodded and stepped away from her father's side to kneel in the straw that held the row of sleeping piglets. In the next pen, the big sow shoved her snout through the gap between boards. Kalee placed a gentle finger on the first piglet. "One," she said, and moved her finger down the row, "two, three, four, five, six, and seven. Seven, Daddy."

"Keep this up and I just might make you my official pig counter."

She giggled and reached for the fifth pig, the only one awake. The piglet squealed, twisting his tubular body, but she held him against her blue dress until he settled. She stroked his tiny head. A sigh softly extended and deflated his sides.

"I wish you wouldn't bring her out here with you, Ben," her mother said, leaning over the side of the pen and picking her up. "Put it down, Kalee."

"Nothing wrong with showing her the newborns." Her father took the piglet from Kalee, placing it back with the others. "It's educational."

"And when she gives them all names, and asks where you've taken them six months from now, what will you tell her?" Her mother smelled of both pantry and garden. Pink lipstick covered her lips. She inspected Kalee and wiped dirt from her dress.

"She'll lose interest once they're too big to hold." Her father stepped into the aisle.

"I hope you're right."

"I'm always right." He leaned in with his strong scent of barn, squishing Kalee between them, and stole the shine from her mother's lips.

Kalee looked again at the newborns. The piglet she had held looked up at her. Since her mother seemed upset that Kalee might give him a name, she decided to stick with his number instead. "Bye, Five," she called, as her mother set her down and led her by the hand from the barn.

For the next several weeks she often snuck down to the barns to visit Five and the others, but by mid-June, her interest began to wane. Five had become too heavy to hold, just as her father predicted, and he was often muddy from his excursions to the outside pen.

But it was only after Kalee received a grey kitten for her fifth birthday that Five faded altogether. He left her thoughts as soon as she opened the box and gathered the pretty kitten against her. The kitten was soft and light, and when she put him down, he bounced and leapt and chased everything from shadow to string. She named him Rain.

—

Before long it was September, and the start of her first school day. Kalee refused to leave her room, holding Rain close, and shaking her head furiously when her mother tried to take the kitten from her.

"You have to go to school, Kalee."

"Why?"

"So you can make friends, learn, and grow up to become someone important."

"But I don't want to be important."

"Everyone wants to be important, Kalee."

—

In the end, she went. She had no choice. And she soon found herself traveling most days, to and from town by school bus. It was often loud on the bus. The children talked and shouted and threw things until the bus driver had to shout in order to quiet them. Kalee often covered her ears, and watched the outside world pass her by, a world of farms and pastures and lines of trees.

During class she sat on the floor, part of a great circle of children that ringed their teacher, Ms. Adams. Ms. Adams read very slowly and showed them cards with letters and words. Kalee enjoyed learning, but she shied from her fellow classmates, never quite knowing how to include herself in their games. She knew how important it was to make friends, because her mother asked her every day after school if she made any. Sometimes Kalee lied and said she was friends with Molly Green. This lie seemed to make her mother happy, and so she made up stories about Molly and her, and told them at dinner. In reality she waited for each school day to hurry up and finish, so she could return home, sit with her mom, play with her kitten, practice her letters, and fall to sleep every night wondering how she would ever make friends.

Then Five showed up one night in mid-October. It was on the same evening that her mother exchanged her yellow summer blanket for the heavier purple quilt. She was drifting off to sleep under its comfortable weight when a soft sigh caused her to sit up.

Five stood by her closet, framed somewhat by Kalee's unruly auburn curls that had strayed to the edges of her peripheral vision. She knew it was her pig even though he was now big and creamy with stiff hairs.

Five lifted his snout and sniffed the air before taking a tentative step towards her.

She stared at him, wondering if she should call for her father but Five interrupted her thoughts by speaking.

"If you wouldn't mind, Kalee, might I snuggle up against you like I once did when I was younger? It is just that I had a terrible day and I can't shake the unquiet from my soul."

"You are awfully big for my bed, Five."

"Yes, but I can assure you I weigh no more than your kitten now."

"Okay, come up then."

Five jumped easily onto the purple quilt to lie across Kalee, placing his head against her small chest. Kalee's heart quickened as she put her open hands on the pig's big head, rubbing him at the base of his ears. She sat like that for several moments before saying. "Is this okay? Do you feel better, Five?"

Five nodded and Kalee watched his body rise and fall gently with his sigh. She smiled. And as she held him he left, simply dissolving into the air around her. She ran her fingers along the top of her quilt. A slight indent of pig still lingered but nothing else. Since the encounter hadn't scared her, she didn't wake her parents. Instead she got down off her bed and gathered Rain from the cushioned armchair where he slept, bringing him beneath the blanket with her. She drifted off with the scent of kitten under her nose.

In the morning before the bus arrived she went to the barn where she was greeted only by the big sow. The stall her piglets had occupied was empty and swept clean.

"What happened to the young pigs?" Kalee asked that evening at dinner.

"They were sold." Her father answered. "They grew too big to keep."

Kalee sighed and pushed her plate away. She wished she had remained friends with Five. It might have made him important.

The next night a second pig visited her. It was not one of her father's pigs. He had ears that fell over his eyes, and a brown spot on his back. He kept his head lowered.

"I met Five the other day," the pig said. "We traveled in the big truck together. He mentioned you. That you had a comforting way."

She opened her arms. The pig jumped up onto her bed and she held him until he too faded away. He was different from her father's pigs and thinking that being remembered was the same as being important, she switched on her light and took out her old letter book that had plenty of blank pages left in it.

On the first clean page she drew a picture of both pigs that had visited her, trying to include their differences.

Under the picture of Five she wrote in large letters 'my pig', and under the second she printed the words, 'big ear pig'. Satisfied that she captured them well on the page, she put her scribbler away and fell asleep.

—

Rain grew into a cat, and began visiting both field and barn on his daily excursions. Her father often praised Rain for being a good mouser and this made Kalee blush with pride for she loved her cat.

So it was grand news to learn one night that Rain also loved her. A mouse, who sat small and grey on her bedpost, gave Kalee this information. Kalee knew straight off that he wasn't a full mouse. He was like the pigs.

"Your cat loves you very much," the mouse said.

"How do you know?"

"Because your cat likes to play a game she calls capture. In between batting me back and forth for a good several minutes, she talked non-stop about you. I had little interest in her chatter at the time, but when she finally ended my torment, I found myself alone and unable to return to my family. It was then that I remember hearing that you had a comforting touch, and I would very much appreciate a little comfort if you have any to spare. Your cat was far from kind and I am very much shaken by the experience." The mouse ran back and forth along her wooden footboard as he spoke.

"I'm sorry, mouse. My dad says it is hard to make a cat mind, and that her job is to keep this farm mice-free as possible. But if I can help at all, please let me." She laid an open palm on her quilt and the little mouse scurried over and up onto it. She laughed. As light as he was his small paws still tickled. She brought it up to her face and stared into its miniscule black eyes. Its nose twitched, its tail moved, it ran up to the tips of her fingers and back down to her wrist. He looked over the edge of her hand and back up into her face again.

"You are a nervous little thing, aren't you?"

"I come by it naturally. I spent my whole life running from bigger things." He shook his body.

With one finger she gently stroked his fur, from head to hindquarters. She did it several times until the little mouse sighed and lay quietly in her palm.

"You do have a comforting touch," the mouse whispered before fading away.

She reached into her drawer and pulled out her book and drew the mouse below the pigs.

Under the small drawing she printed the words, 'small and nervos'.

Spring arrived and when the cherry tree outside her window layered her screen with white blossom, she awoke one night to a room full of lambs. They were all soft wool and innocence, pressed together as if they shared one heart.

She recognized them immediately. They were Mr. Trevor's lambs. Kalee often watched them as the school bus drove past his farm. She had first spotted them weeks ago, when they were only days old, when frost still clung to both field and fence post. She remembered how they trotted and frolicked behind their wide woolen mothers.

"What are you all doing here?" she asked.

"We don't know. We miss our mothers. We were taken from them." One small voice spoke for all of them.

Kalee avoided more questions. She felt a lump in her throat that hurt when she swallowed. She held out her arms. "Maybe it is best you come one at a time."

The first little lamb with a creamy body and black legs leapt with such grace onto her bed that it made Kalee smile. It trotted over and fell to it knees, pressing its face into her pajama top. The smell of new grass and spring rain had Kalee taking in a deep breath and leaning her nose close to the wool.

The lamb slid its back hooves beneath its body and lay quite still against Kalee. Kalee patted and hugged the lamb.

"Is this okay, lamb?" she asked.

The little lamb nodded and closed its eyes and soon it faded away. Each lamb that followed, Kalee tried to remember something special about it. Something that made it stand apart from the others. One had a small black spot in the shape of a crescent moon on its chest, another had a thin black stripe above its left eye, and one was so white, even its small cloven hooves were cream colour. Once they were gone, taking the smell of grass and rain with them, she sighed and looked over at Rain who sat watching the scene on the old armchair.

"They all were so terribly young. Their mothers must be sad."

Rain licked her paw. Kalee pulled out her book and began to sketch the lambs. She gave each one a name and a description. This activity took her late into the night because there were so many, and she struggled to spell certain words like 'crescent' and 'innocent'. She finally fell to sleep with her crayons spread around her, her book eventually sliding from her bed to lay open on the floor.

At breakfast, her mother looked over the table at her with her lips pressed and her brow knitted. A few days prior Kalee was forced to tell her mom the truth about Molly because Ms. Adams had mentioned to her mom that Kalee kept to herself too much.

"Kalee, you look like you didn't sleep at all?"

Kalee yawned, "I'm making a book, mom."

"What's it about?"

"It's a list of animals. So they can be remembered. So they can be important."

Her mom smiled. "Well although that sounds like a fine idea, no more late nights".

Kalee nodded, hoping that the visits would stop, at least for a while, because it made her sad that some lives were so short, and less important than others. Who, but their mothers, would remember the little lambs that she had placed in her book.

But word of her comforting ways had spread, and the souls of animals from robin to rooster, tomcat to turkey, visited her, and she felt it only fitting to give them the comfort they came for and to include them in her book. Her nights became a contrast to her days. At night she felt alive in the company of dead animals. In daylight she felt unseen by her lively classmates.

When her first year of school ended, her mother and father took her to the water park to celebrate. After a full and tiring day she fell asleep on the long car ride home.

It was the morning sun that woke her. When she opened her eyes, her view was that of a bull's great face. His horn's points rested on either side of her head, one almost pierced her pillow. She pulled the blanket up around her, thankful it wasn't red and asked, "Might you step back, you're scaring me?

He snorted and his big tongue came out to lick the iron ring that hung from his wet snout. He stomped a hoof down on her carpeted floor and took a step back, bumping into her dresser. When he lowered his brown head, the glint of a new day highlighted a rim of pink around his eyes. "Sorry," he mumbled. "But I've been here all night waiting for you to wake."

Kalee sat up and rubbed her eyes. Her heart quickened, wondering if her mom or dad might peek in. She gulped and looked at the huge animal that filled her room. Since he showed patience not to wake her; she felt she owed him patience in return.

"Where did you come from?"

"It's hard to say for sure. I'm a rodeo bull. The circuit takes me everywhere. I was very sought after. My owner always got top dollar for me. You might even call me a celebrity. Maybe you heard of me. My name is Far Flung," he said proudly.

"What happened?"

"Well, you don't get top bull status without showcasing a little, and so I act up sometimes. But the last time I did, I got my darn hoof caught in the chute's gate, and broke my leg trying to wrestle out of it. The pain was as bad as my branding day. Anyway, heavy bull, broken leg, doesn't take a genius to figure what they did next."

"But you were a star. Why didn't they fix you?"

Far Flung lifted his shoulders slightly. "I wasn't that big of a star."

She opened her arms. "Come here."

He stepped up near her and she wrapped her arms around his thick neck. "You did good Far Flung. Maybe there will be cowboys where you're going and you can be a star again."

"If it's my choice, I would prefer a meadow with no fences."

"Oh, I'm sure you'll find that." she kissed him between his wide set eyes and he sighed.

"They were right about you, Kalee. You have a comforting way." He faded but his big nature remained to fill the room long after he was gone.

—

At the start of grade three, Kalee finally decided on a name for her book. She titled it "The Book of Barnyard Souls." It was a big book, consisting of five full scribblers, a pad of construction paper and many sheets of loose leaf. She had tied a piece of baling twine around it to keep it all together. Both her descriptions and portraits of the visiting animals became longer and more detailed. She kept the book beneath her bed.

She continued to have visitors, and she tried to keep their visits just a little longer each time, asking questions about their brief lives so she could tell their stories well. Kalee also became a better artist with all her nights of practice and soon she put aside her wax crayons and coloured markers, preferring the shading capability of drawing pencils.

And now that she had met and conversed with many barnyard souls, she no longer visited the butcher shop with her mother, or walked near the long freezer display cases at the supermarket. And with every soul she met, she felt a little sadder that she was the one they had chosen to make them important, because she was just too shy to show the book to any of her classmates.

Sometime she heard her mother and father whispering about her. That she looked tired, that she was too quiet, that they wished she had friends. Kalee wished the same.

Her parent's concern grew, and thinking they were helping they sent Kalee to camp the following summer. The camp overlooked a beautiful lake that was surrounded by old growth forest.

"It's very hard not to make friends at camp. I know you will make many," her mother said as she kissed her good-bye.

But the only friendships Kalee made were the ones after lights out. The very first night, as she lay on the top bunk, the soul of a black bear climbed the ladder to sit at her feet. She sighed, sat up and pulled out her book and her flashlight. During the nights that followed she met many other wild souls, from sightless moles to porcupine. Even a great bald eagle perched himself in the wooden rafter above her bunk and he spoke in length to her about his life. He told her how much he loved circling high above the land, just knowing sunlight passed through his wingtips first before falling across the tree tops and lakes. Like the others, she placed his likeness in her book, spending a great deal of time sketching his wings so they folded properly.

When she returned from camp, her parents looked long at her. Her mother started to cry. Her father frowned. Figuring she must have gotten the same rash as the girl on the bus that sat beside her, she ran into the bathroom to look in the mirror. But besides her pale complexion, and the half-moon-shaped darkness beneath her eyes, she looked fine.

Her mother brought her to a doctor anyway. He took a battery of tests, finding nothing. Her mother then took her to Dr. Kim, a psychologist. As Kalee sat on Dr. Kim's comfortable couch one afternoon, she was impressed with the full bookshelves and the many framed certificates on the wall, each one holding Dr. Kim's name. Dr. Kim must be very important, she deduced.

Dr. Kim sat across from her. Kalee tried to look normal. She kept her hands in her lap and both feet together.

"What activities do you like?" Dr. Kim asked.

"I like to draw."

"And what do you draw?"

"Animals."

"What's your favourite animal to draw?"

She paused. This question proved difficult. "I guess mice. They're easy. But I get tired trying to draw birds. It is hard getting feathers right."

"Why is it important to get their features right?"

"So I can tell them apart. So I can remember each one. But it is getting harder and harder because they keep coming, and I don't like leaving anyone out. I just want to make them important."

"And why do you think they wish to be important, Kalee?'

Kalee shrugged and looked again at the certificates that filled Dr. Kim's wall.

The Doctor fell quiet and began to write. When their session was finished, Kalee remained on the couch while Dr. Kim spoke to her mother in hush tones and handed her a prescription.

That night her mother gave Kalee a pill at bedtime.

"What does it do?" Kalee asked.

"It helps you sleep. Dr. Kim thinks you're not sleeping enough."

"No, thank you."

"Kalee it is not up for discussion. Take it."

Kalee took it and slept the entire night without a single soul waking her.

The pills became a regular bedtime routine for the next few months, and her nights that were once so crowded, were now empty and short, with out even the memory of a pleasant dream to begin each day with. Except for the warmness of her cat curled against her, she never received another visitor.

At first she was relieved to have the burden of providing comfort every night off her shoulders. She was also relieved that she was now able to concentrate more on her schoolwork and had energy left over to join the art club. But although she was now a different child, awake and alert, she remained withdrawn, spending most of her days alone.

Longing for company, alive or dead, one night Kalee spit her pill into her palm as soon as her mother left the room. She sat up and waited, but no one came. She fell asleep near morning, disappointed. It wasn't that she wanted to see animals in need of comfort, but it was the only thing that made her feel important too, and now it was over.

—

She became a tall, slim teenager who hid herself in oversized t-shirts and kept her hair short enough to prevent it from curling. She painted constantly, now preferring oils on large white canvas. But she refused to paint animals or people or even plants, preferring to paint inanimate objects like cameras and lawn chairs and sinks full of dishes. Her art gained local praise and after graduating she was accepted into a prestigious art school. Her parents were proud, but hesitant to see her leave the farm. They thought her melancholy ways might not bode well in the city.

But Kalee found a certain kinship with the city's treeless streets, and so when she finished her studies, she stayed on, renting a small studio loft. She soon made a small income on her paintings.

Her parents came into the city to attend one of her exhibits. She smiled and hugged them close to her. Her mother still smelled of pantry and garden, her dad still held a lingering scent of barn. Afterwards, she made them tea while her mother walked about her apartment trying to rub dry paint from Kalee's cushions and window curtains.

"Mom, what do you think of my latest one." Kalee pointed with the teapot she held towards a field full of light bulbs.

Her mother reached out and tenderly touched the large bulb in the forefront, "I remember you use to draw animals. Wouldn't animals be easier to sell than these? They just seem a tad cold, Kalee."

"Robert Bateman," her father spoke up from where he sat on her small couch, a teacup in his hand. "He painted animals."

Kalee smiled. "Yes, dad, I know."

"He's known world-wide. A very important painter."

Kalee kept to her smile. "That he is."

"When do you think you might get home next, Kalee. We miss you. The cat misses you." her mom interrupted.

"Hopefully soon, Mom."

—

Her mother called her a month later to tell her that Rain died. Kalee spent the entire night waiting up, hoping Rain might visit. It would've been a pleasure to hear what her old cat had to say. But she was once again disappointed.

Kalee remained in the city for years, but she returned home when her parents became of an age that they needed help to maintain the place. Her father no longer kept pigs, and had downsized the garden into a devotion, not a livelihood. As for Kalee she moved her studio into the foyer where the light was good. In the evenings she sat on the porch or played crib with her parents, and her life felt like it had circled around, ending up where it began.

One afternoon, as she searched for her winter boots in the back of her closet, she found, "The Book of Barnyard Souls" wedged between shoeboxes. It had not been touched in many years. She pulled it out, blew off the dust, untied the bindings, and opened the first page to the crude drawing of Five. She smiled and let a tear escape.

She moved through the pages, running a finger over the crescent moon on the little lamb's face, over the big brown eyes of the bear that had been lured into a field by a pile of garbage and shot for sport. She kissed the drawing of Far Flung, and paused on the page that held several kittens. All abandoned to a long ago winter's night. It had been the pleasure of her life to meet them all, and she suddenly felt very fortunate to have had such an opportunity.

Out of all her work, this unseen book of aging pages, crude drawings and child prose, was her greatest, and had trapped most of her heart.

"What you got there?"

She turned. Her father stood in the doorway. It was the first time she noticed how stooped he was, and how he held himself to the left a little, like perhaps his right hip was sore. "Just one of my old drawing books. You up for a game of crib tonight?"

"Thought you would never ask."

She smiled and took the book with her as she left the room, depositing it in the foyer near her canvas. After her parents retired for the night, she opened, "The Book of Barnyard Souls," to Far Flung and began to paint his likeness on a huge, clean square of canvas. She pulled from her paints and her memory all the details she could remember, painting long into the night, and when she finally stopped, her hands cramped, she laughed out loud for she had captured the proud, intelligent beast as fine as if he stood there. This satisfied her so much that it made up for half a lifetime of painting dishtowels and rain gutters. It had even lifted the corners of her melancholy.

She left the house for some air, sitting down on the top step of the porch. It was November and the air was strong with winter's breath. She rubbed her hands together and watched the sky slowly turn peony pink. She looked up as a sparrow landed on the bare branches of their pear tree. It cocked its head and sang straight into a single ray of morning. She smiled and shook her head. How she loved this farm and her parents. Did it really take her an entire lifetime to realize that she had it wrong in her youth? Those sweet beasts that had visited her had just wanted one final moment of warmth. It was never about being immortalized in a book or on canvas.

The door opened and her mother poked her head out. "Kalee, are you trying to freeze to death?"

"I'll be in a minute. Just enjoying the sunrise."

"Did you paint that bull last night?"

"Yes, I did. Do you like it?"

"I certainly do. He's so life like. You certainly did the beast proud."

"He was a pretty proud beast to start with mom. But thank you." She turned and looked at her mother. Her mother was smaller now, her hair thinner, her shoulders a bent hanger under her heavy bathrobe, but she still wore the same shade of lipstick she had worn her entire life. Kalee said "You look nice, Mom."

Her mom stood a little straighter, and patted her hair, looking pleased with the compliment.

Kalee smiled. Her mom smiled back and said "You picked a cold morning to enjoy the sunrise, but I'll leave you to it."

She went back inside. Kalee turned back to the sparrow. Its small head hid beneath a wing while the morning sun established its significance in every feather. Kalee couldn't think of a better canvas, a better page, a better moment for the bird than the one it was in. She sent a wish for it to have many more such moments, for all things to have their moments, before rising and going inside to help her mother with breakfast.
