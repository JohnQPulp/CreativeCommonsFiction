Outside, the new La Salle gleamed — its shining, hulking form waiting for her to rumble its motor to life. Accelerating down the highway, she imagined it to be in the throes of ecstasy. But it would have to wait for its passion (and she, hers). After months of research and test upon test, Agricultural Physics as the world knew it stood on the brink of an amazing discovery. Still, the La Salle haunted her like a demon-lover. She wanted to drive!

"C'mon, Giorgi, let's take ten and go for a spin."

"Spin! Dat's eet! De spin of de protein molecule must match exactly de spin of de proton around de soy-atomic nuclear. Dis will give us de bean!"

"Do you mean the soy-atomic or the sub-atomic?"

"Oh sheet. Dat fuss de whole ting up!"

"I'm sorry, Giorgio," she sighed. She knew how excited he got several times a day when he was sure he had the answer. She just couldn't help shooting his revelations full of holes. "He's such a wimp," she thought. "The only 'beeg bean' he's liable to discover is out in the parking lot — that Nazi, bean-looking car of his. Mom's sewing machine sounds heartier than that little pisswagon he drives."

It drove her crazy. No proper man would be caught dead in that thing. But Giorgio was no proper man. He was a genius — a wimpy, faggoty, genius. She'd kill him before she let him discover bean one.

"Fuss it, I can't tink no more. I take dat drive wit choo, but choo no gonna fast-drive, right? No helmet dis time driving, 'kay?"

"Okay, c'mon!"

The parking lot was empty except for her La Salle and Giorgio's "bean." The moon was sharp in the cold, cloudless desert night. She could see Oppenheimer drinking coffee and reading in the guard shack by the gate. "Now there's a man," Maladi thought, "sixteen cylinders and all of them pumping." Tall, thin and wired on the gallons of coffee he drank, his was a motor she could overhaul! But his mind was mush. He once told her he was working on a formula to release energy from atoms — to create little, earth-bound suns. "And do what with them," she'd asked, "grow beans?"

Maladi opened her door and threw the key across the roof to Giorgio. By the time he fumbled his way into the car she could have her skirt hiked up and her bare ass on the cool, leather seat. There was no other way to drive for her, but she'd be damned if she'd let Giorgio find out she didn't wear panties. She actually hated letting him sit in her car.

"So, where we're driving dis time, Mal? I'm could be goin' for some cappuccino if we weren't in dis damn desert."

"No cappuccino in Los Alamos" she said. Or any other heterosexual place in the universe, she thought.

"Dat's too bad."

As she promised, Maladi left the helmet in the trunk. The goggles, however, she retrieved from the dash. Giorgio whimpered as she put them on. "I gotta wear the goggles, Giorgio. Sorry." With precision she slid her key into the slot. It excited her. The pounding of eight big pistons brought her to a peak. Flicking her foot off the clutch, gravel flew and tires squealed as she slid to the gate and came to a lurching halt at the guard shack. Oppenheimer looked up at her, coffee running down his shirt and pants. He, too, would never get used to her driving.

"Whatcha doin', Oppie," she called out the open window, "trying to discover a pure-caffeine bean?"

Giorgio roared laughter, slapping his knees with his palms. "Dat guy's such a jerk. He's a musser fussin' night watchman what tinks he's a pissasist! I'm gonna make heem my assistant instead of choo, Mal."

"Don't listen to Giorgio, Oppie. He's just jealous he didn't think up fusion or whatever you call it."

"Fission," Oppenheimer whispered as the La Salle roared off.

Maladi and Giorgio drove through the desert. The goggles Mal wore were essential. She loved to drive with her head out the window and her mouth open wide, deep throating the dry, night air.

"Choo lookin' like a big, red-headed dog when choo're doin' dat, Mal. Choo're lookin' like an impish setter, I'm tinkin'."

"That's Irish setter," she yelled past the screaming wind in her face. "You know, like potatoes. Irish!"

"Dat's eet! It's like de potato-atomics. De dirty potato molecule spins to de tune of de soy-atomics and we have de bean!"

Maladi ran the equation through her mind, looking for the fault she always found. She couldn't find one. It wasn't there. Her accelerator foot came off the floor-board and crashed into the brake. Four tons of La Salle spun three-sixties around and around the desert highway. When they finally came to a stop amidst their own dust storm, Giorgio was shrieking in panic. His eyes were wet with tears of fear and he'd pissed himself. "What in de flyin' fuss choo're doin' dat for, Mal? Choo're scarin' dis piss right out of me on my pants!"

Still, her mind fought to find the error in his formula. There simply wasn't one. He was right. He'd discovered the bean. She looked at him, quivering and wet on her leather seat. "Tell me something, Giorgio, are you queer or what?"

"Am I'm queer or what? What kind question choo're assin' me now, when I'm discover de bean?"

Maladi reached across him to the glove box. Inside was a nine-millimeter, German Lugar. Loaded. She opened the box and pulled it out. "I'm asking you if you're queer, Giorgio, because I want to know if I should give you one last fuck-of-your-lifetime before I blow your brains out."

"Maladi, what choo're sayin'? I'm like boys!"

"Good," she said. Three loud bangs later Giorgio was nearly headless and totally dead on the brown, leather seat of her new La Salle. His blood was diluted with his piss. As she sat looking at his pathetic, dead body it dawned on her that he may have shit on her seat as well.

Oppenheimer knew something was wrong when he saw the La Salle creeping down the highway toward his shack. Inside the car, Maladi was thinking, scheming. To her right was a dead genius who'd just given her the secret of soy-atomic fuchsia. Grown Coal. The energy source of the future, now! Soot-faced miners would be replaced by field hands. No more, "when dem cotton balls get rotten." Instead, they'd be picking Maladi's beans.

But what would she do with the dead flit in her car. "At the very least," she thought, "I'm going to need a lot of powerful cleaning fluid to get that mess off my seat." The guard shack was coming up, growing in the distance like the immediacy of her problem. Oppenheimer, it seemed, held her fate. She had a plan.

When she pulled up to the shack, Oppenheimer was to her left, Giorgio's remains being pretty much out of his sight. "Oppie, I've got a problem. You're good at solving problems. Do you think you can help me?"

Part of Maladi's plan included hiking up her skirt so that Oppenheimer couldn't help but notice she was sitting on her bare ass. But even that view of her exposed lap fed into Oppy's obsession with nuclear fission. The sight of those thighs made him think of explosions — white clapping thunder and the annihilation of fire. It was a double turn-on that chugged his motor into overdrive.

Maladi was crying in his guard shack, now, smoothing her wrinkled skirt down to her knees. Between coughing sips of Oppenheimer's coffee she weaved a tale. "He tried to rape me, Oppie. Before I knew he had my dress up and my panties off. I hit the break, but when we stopped he had a gun. German, like that car he drives. Good God, do you think he was a Nazi?"

"Communist," Oppenheimer whispered.

She crept closer then, pressing against him. "When he put his hand between my legs, when he touched me there," she breathed at him, her face in his face, "I took his gun and it came free. I shot and shot and shot. He was dead."

Subtle as a shark eating, she had him in her hand. He was no match for her feminine wiles. Giorgio's lifeless, half gone head bounced to the love/lament rocking of the La Salle…on its springs…from its long back seat.

All the papers carried the news of the Nazi-Communist who'd tried to rape the lady-physicist who'd discovered the bean. Her new assistant, Oppenheimer, was said to be such a genius he could polish her cars and work physics equations in his head at the same time. They were rarely apart.

The war in Europe was nearly over. Soon the Nazi's and Communists would be enslaved to the Capitalist world. It was just a matter of time. But the Imperialist Japanese were another story. The South Pacific was still their oyster, and their greedy little eyes were once again staring down Hawaii. Rumor was they had a bean of their own.

Maladi could care less. She was happy! She was rich! Each day she and Oppenheimer returned to her private research facility. Inside, amidst nuclear accelerators, Fermi reactors and ticking boxes from a man named Geiger, she rebuilt her motors. Buggattis and Mercedes. Rolls and Jaguars. Lincolns. And Oppenheimer shined. He was to car wax what the bean was to the new world order. In the black and white and gray shine of fenders and hoods, he saw equations. And he saw the sun blazing there like death and destruction. He had nothing against the Japanese. He'd never cared for the Nazis, and he could take or leave the Communists. But beyond his waxed fingers he saw an imaginary button he'd be glad to push, just to see that big bang once. He was such a purist. Fire never discriminates.

Every night, after he'd satiated Maladi's almost violent desire, he returned to the facility at Los Alamos. Without malice, his thoughts conveyed to himself one message, "Fuck a bunch of piss ant beans, I want to see it all at once!"

It was unusual for Maladi to wake up before nine or ten in the morning. After her nightly collision with Oppenheimer she'd roll off him (or, rarely, out from under him) and fall immediately, soundly to sleep. The sleep of the dead. Few things but physics interested Oppenheimer, but the depth of Maladi's sleeping intrigued him. He once sodomized her in her sleep and she never moved. Another time he put her hand, to the wrist, in a pot of warm water. He actually smiled as she peed the bed. No one was there (and awake) to see the smile.

But this night her sleep was troubled. She had taken the bottom position during intercourse and lay there, unmoved, throughout the exercise. She actually forgot she was being fucked. And though she'd closed her eyes afterward, she was not asleep. Instead she was visualizing a great field of soy-atomic beans. The lemon-sized fruits, reddish-gray, dangled in the breeze. In her vision, she was driving a Stutz Bearcat through the field. In the center of it stood Oppenheimer. His hands were clasped together as if he'd caught a butterfly. As she drove closer and closer to him she could see he was about to open his hands and let whatever was in them loose. She could swear light was escaping from between his fingers. Suddenly, when she was nearly upon him, he spread his hands and there appeared a tiny sun. The sun took flight and flew about frantically, touching each bean in the field and igniting it. Soon the entire field was ablaze with the brightly lit beans, each burning hotter than a hundred times its weight in coal. When the Stutz began to melt she sat up. She was sweating profusely. Her mouth was dry. She looked for Oppenheimer in the bed next to her. He was gone.

The Japanese were about to take Hawaii. Everyone knew this. Everyone was scared. Everyone but Maladi and Oppenheimer. Maladi wasn't afraid because she didn't care. Her mechanical addiction was all-consuming. Oppenheimer was actually happy. Ecstatic. His equations were complete. Soon he would present the allies with a weapon to put an end to the yellow-menace. He had nothing against them, those Japanese, but their lives were a zero in his equations. They just didn't matter. What mattered was the reality behind his formulas. Without the reality they were just paper, and that he could not abide.

He was in the facility, gathering his work to present to the government in the morning. When they understood they would build the device. It was a shoe-in. "Oppie, what are you doing here? I wanted you and you weren't in bed." Oppenheimer turned to see Maladi. She was wearing a trench-coat over her thin, opaque nightgown. He blinked his eyes in greeting. "I couldn't sleep," she continued. "I kept thinking about your little suns."

"Fission," Oppenheimer whispered.

"What are you doing, Oppie? What's all this?" she asked indicating his paperwork.

"Fission," he whispered again.

"It's the little suns, isn't it? You've done it, haven't you?"

He blinked.

"Oppie, we don't need the little suns, we have the beans. All the energy we need and the real sun to grow them with. I want you to come home now and forget all this," she said, going for his formulas.

In a drawer, behind him, was Maladi's German Lugar. He had removed it from the La Salle for safe keeping. His safe keeping. Feminine wiles or no, he knew what she was capable of. Quickly he turned and retrieved it before she could snatch up his work. It felt clammy in his hand as he pointed it at her.

"You know you can't kill me, Oppie. But what's worse for you is, I know you can't. It's okay. Give me the gun and we'll go. I promise I'll leave your little suns alone."

He knew she was lying. When she took a step forward he shot her in the foot. "You son-of-a-bitch," she howled, "that's my clutch foot!" Leaning hard against a table, she came toward him again and he shot her other foot. As she fell, she screamed. "You don't have the balls to kill me, do you? You're as dickless as Giorgio!"

The Lugar was aimed at her gorgeous red head, but he knew as well as she did that he couldn't kill her. It had nothing to do with her beauty, nothing to do with the sex they'd shared. He just couldn't kill anyone. Not in person.

The sound of a gunshot startled him. He knew he hadn't pulled the trigger. As he fell he saw the guard in the doorway with the smoking gun. "Shit," he whispered as he died.

All the papers carried the story about the Communist who'd shot and tried to rape the woman who'd discovered the bean. What they didn't carry was the story of Oppenheimer's work, which was now in government hands.

Maladi rode her battery powered wheelchair through the facility. Her cars were gone. The place was frantic with scientists and technicians building Oppie's device. All work with soy-atomics was put on hold in deference to his little suns. And even though Maladi was, in show, put in charge of the project, she knew she was a figurehead. After all, they couldn't give the credit to a Communist.

They were all working on what looked like two giant, steel melons with fins. They were nearly complete. One of the scientists saw her coming. Even with her hugely bandaged feet, she was beautiful. "Would you like to name them, Maladi?" he asked her.

For some reason she thought of Giorgio. "Yeah," she sneered, "call them Fat Man and Little Boy."
