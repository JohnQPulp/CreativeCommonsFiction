David walked north along Nauset beach at dawn. A chair made him stop, when night and cold and exhaustion had not: a chair, waterlogged, stained but not rotten, the wood smoothed and rounded by ages of drifting, its legs in the air. He heaved it out of the sand, leaving hollows behind that caved as he righted it. He rolled his trouser-cuffs higher, pushed back his shirt sleeves, and sat. He leaned over his knees, bare toes dug into the freezing cold beach at the very edge of the ocean.

A wave crashed past him, caught the sand as high as it could reach and pulled. Land slid out from under David's heels, and he sank another quarter-inch. Of the line of his footprints leading south, back towards his life, the closest section disappeared.

The morning mists obscured the shore, mirrored the waves, the voids of their billows and curves foiling linear thought by the constant illusion of motion. This vertigo the chair arrested, providing a frame of reference all its own.

Out of the mists, a pale girl appeared. She wore a black bathing suit, had straight brown hair and carried a towel. She wasn't at all like Eleanora.

"Good morning," she said.

David acknowledged, his voice barely audible above the surf.

She dropped the towel at the edge of the dry part of the beach, ran towards the water kicking up sand as though it were foam, and dove into the face of a wave. The roaring solitude returned. She reappeared among gray swells, swimming.

The fog's veil drew back, revealing the sun. David hadn't slept; the bright hurt his eyes. Eleanora after she'd betrayed him, sitting on the open windowsill in white.

No, she had never worn white.

Another wave hit its peak and toppled; the girl emerged, surfacing out of the whitecap like a ship's figurehead. The wave rolled her onto the shore. David folded his fingers over his aching eyes.

"Are you staying with the Magdalas?"

"No."

"The Roches?"

"I walked here."

"Walked from where?"

"From the Chatham Light."

"That's twenty miles."

David waited, then parted his fingers. She was still there, drying her hair. He closed them again.

"It must be a beautiful walk," she said.

He remembered the night. The Milky Way above the dunes. The Nauset Light. The black hole in his stomach. The howls of birds.

He forced his legs straight and reached for his toes. His muscles ached as only twenty miles of sand can make them. He stretched until the pain shot up his calves and thighs and flashed red-black behind his eyes.

When he no longer felt the sun, he looked. The gray veil had closed. The waves had smoothed away his footprints. She was still there.

"I stopped for a rest," he said. "Then I'll go on."

"How far are you going?"

"To Race Point."

"The whole Outer Cape? Why?"

He gripped the chair.

The girl wrapped the towel around her waist and pulled back her damp, dark hair. "I hope you make it," she said, as though to deny all his efforts at incivility. She walked up the beach.

The sun rose and burned back the mist. There were voices in the sawgrass, then the creak of wood and figures on the stairs.

The sand sprouted fat people, screaming children, bamboo mats and umbrellas. The reek of sunblock overpowered the brine. Among the gray waves far out where no one swam, sailboats passed, one or two in an hour.

A hard-bodied lifeguard and a girl in a bikini strolled by, arms around each other's waists, blocking his view. A whisper. A giggle. The subtle motion of a hand. He despised them. He despised their stupid innocence, their mimicked gestures. Puppets. Puppets of love, a thing they could not understand.

On the north horizon, where he ought to be, mirages shimmered over baking sand. He ought to be walking. Shrill children with shovels and pails dug moats and built castles around him.

Eleanora's fingerprints on empty glasses. Her shoes by the door. Red-gold hair on her brush. Her bottles lined against the bathroom mirror, bookended by lumps of flesh. His skin began to burn. He dragged the chair under the wooden stairs and sat in the slatted shadows. The sun rolled towards the dunes.

The human chaos dismantled itself and lumbered up the stairs to the parking lots and changing rooms. A beachball had caught on the tip of a whitecap, forgotten, pushed east by the wind, pulled west by the current, constantly rolling, going nowhere.

David dozed; he woke to footsteps. The dunes cast shadows beneath a violet sky. He dragged the chair back into the sun, stepping over moats and castles already washing out to sea. The dark-haired girl met him emerging from her swim. "I figured you'd have gone," she said.

She was shorter than Eleanora. Eleanora's head had fit under his chin. And when he knelt… "I can't decide. I might go back."

"But you're halfway already."

"You're right." He sank into the chair. "Maybe I'll sit here forever."

She walked around him, around the chair, leaving clean footprints in the wet sand. In each imprint, the middle toe was slightly too long. "It's a beautiful chair. Did you see what's carved here?"

He got up and turned the chair on one leg. On the back of the headrest was carved a shallow relief of a seal, the detail worn away. Dim words, illegible. "Le Phoque Gris," he guessed. "A ship?"

"I'd like to borrow it sometime. After you're done with it, I mean. To paint."

"What — restore it? I like it how it is."

"No, no — to paint a picture. A landscape maybe. It's interesting, don't you think? A driftwood chair."

Her eyes were green like Eleanora's. He hated himself for looking.

The shadow of the dunes had reached the surf. Chill breezes raced the water, brushing his ankles and sunburned neck, sucking warmth away like leeches. "I better get home and get dry," she said.

He unrolled the sleeves of his shirt, buttoned the cuffs.

"Have you got someplace to sleep?"

He looked at the chair.

"Have you eaten?"

"At the hot dog stand." He hadn't.

She headed for the stairs. Her footprints lost their shape, became oval hollows among numberless others. Then she came back and held out a hand. Eleanora's, french-manicured, white-knuckled gripping the bedpost.

"I'm Kate."

"David," he said, flinching.

She folded her arms. "So why are you doing this, David?"

He unrolled a thumb from one of his fists and jerked it north. "That way, somewhere between here and Race Point, I get over her." He opened a finger from the same fist, pointing south. "The other way I forgive her."

Finally, he'd made her uncomfortable. He looked at his toes, curled them up gripping the sand.

"Guess I'll see you in the morning, then." Her hair cast cold salt across him as she turned.

He pulled the chair into the lee of a dune, unrolled his pants, buttoned his shirt to his throat and sat hugging his knees. A tern screamed among the marshes. He leaned his head back against the chair and slept.

At dawn, she dropped her towel beside him without stopping, ran for the water and dove.

David waited for her at the water line, hands in his pockets, shifting from foot to foot. She emerged. "It gets cold at night," he said.

"You could have kept walking," she answered, dripping. She wrapped the towel around her. Part of it came off and slipped to the sand. He realized she'd brought two.

"What's that for?"

"I thought you might want it — to swim."

"It's freezing."

"Everyone says that. It's not so bad. The shock clears the head."

"Too cold," he said.

She shrugged. "So use it as a blanket."

He wrapped the towel around his shoulders. It was warm. He sat in the sand at the high water line, hugged his knees and closed the towel around them.

Kate's footsteps scrunched away, then scrunched back, something dragging behind. She settled the driftwood chair and sat, spreading her towel over her lap. She crossed her ankles.

"How'd you sleep?"

"That ship, the Gray Seal, le Phoque Gris. It's a sailing ship, a pleasure ship, from the Bay of Biscay. There was a party on deck, and she — she wanted to dance. I wouldn't. She danced with the captain instead. She'd come over between songs. Kiss me. Then she'd go back. I just sat in the chair."

Razor-clam holes bubbled as a wave pulled back from the sand. "A nightmare." The corners of her towel fluttered. "You think it's trying to tell you something?"

"What? The chair?"

"A wrinkle appeared above her nose. "The dream."

He squeezed sleep-sand from his eyes. A gull splashed, diving for fish.

Footsteps on the stairs. The first of the day's beachgoers, an elderly couple hand in hand. They teetered past like toddlers, leaning on each other as the sand shifted.

"You know what?" he said, once they were out of earshot. "It was a nightmare, but I didn't want it to end. I just wanted her to kiss me."

She stood, wrapping the towel around her waist.

"Come on. You can't sit here. You'll go crazy. You'll get sunburned to death. I could use a drink — you want a soda?"

She led the way up the wooden stairs. He studied the curve of her spine. There were freckles. Not like Eleanora's.

In the parking lot, he stopped. "Wait."

He went back and heaved the chair into the sawgrass, out of sight.

They had cranberry-lime rickeys, tart and red. David asked for more sugar.

They played mini-golf on a course she'd been to as a kid. One of the holes was a giant plaster whale. You had to putt down into the blowhole; the ball rolled out its mouth. She talked about the Cape in winter. They got ice cream and sat on a bench overlooking the dunes.

Clouds arrived from the ocean. The parking lots emptied. They walked back to her house. "It was my parents'." A faded yellow bungalow with white lattices, grapes growing out of control and an easel in the garden. "Want to see?"

Most of the canvas was blank. In the center left, surrounded by faint, sketched stormy ocean and rocky shore, a seal curled on a promontory, neck twisted towards the viewer, jaws open in a vicious bark. There was black in its mouth.

She closed the door to the house and handed him a drink. He gulped without comment. The seal's gullet yawned.

"So?"

After a whole day with her, bewildered, he'd spent two minutes in her garden, and he knew her. Spiral periwinkle shells and sand-smoothed stones lined the flowerbeds. Inside, tortured hulks of driftwood leaned against the windowpanes. On the door was a leaded mosaic of sea-glass, brown, blue and green: a cloud crossing the sun.

A beachcomber. A scavenger.

She was grieving.

"I don't know," he said. "It's… full of emotion."

She took it off the easel as if it didn't matter, shoved it under her arm. She gestured with her drink at the sky. "It's going to rain tonight. You better not sleep on the beach."

"Watch me," he said.

"Don't be stupid. You thought it was cold last night? You'll get pneumonia. If you kept moving maybe, kept walking. Not if you just sit in that chair."

"I can't keep walking."

"Why not?"

"What if I get to the end of the beach and it isn't long enough? I'd have to swim."

Her flip-flops clapped against the flagstone. She elbowed open the door. "What I'm trying to say, David, is if you want, I can let you sleep here."

The face of the painting hovered, oblique, half in shadow. In the white space behind the angry seal his mind put a ship tilting in a gale. Red hair whipped from the aft deck. He reached into imagined wind and snatched a ribbon.

She never wore ribbons.

His throat was unbearably dry. He finished what was in the glass.

"Not with me, asshole," said Kate. "You can sleep on the couch. I can lend you a pillow. You could take a shower."

"I'll be fine. I'll… buy a tarp in town and sleep under that." He set the glass hurriedly on a flagstone and walked down the driveway.

She let the door slap closed. "You won't be fine. You don't know how high the surf could get — sometimes houses get washed away. What if there's lightning?"

It felt good, the illusion of motion: one leg stretching, then the other, the ground changing, new places coming, old ones behind. Just as if he'd decided already. Her shout arrested his barefooted step at the edge of the street.

"David!"

She came out of the garage embracing a rolled-up sailcloth: white, with a red stripe. She pressed it into his arms.

He bought a pack of cigarettes, some whiskey and a lighter at a package store on the way to the beach. Not that he smoked, or wanted to drink, but he thought it might bring some false warmth.

Wrapped in the sail, the chair shoved against the hurricane fence in the shelter of the dunes, he managed to light a cigarette. The wind dragged it down to ashes faster than he could inhale.

His shins were streaked with red lines from the sawgrass. His stomach burned from the whiskey. The rain stung his skin.

He awoke to pale light, soaking wet, head pounding, cheek pressed to the ground. Grit filled his mouth; he had to wash it out with salt.

The sail. The wind must have caught it.

He found it half a mile north, one corner buried, one dragged by the water, the third caught rippling in the air. He had to fight all three to get it back.

The sky was walled with cloud, but the storm had gone north. He stuffed down the sail in the seat of the chair and sat on top. His mouth tasted awful. He rinsed it with whiskey, lit a crushed cigarette.

Then Kate was beside him in a sweatshirt, hood up and drawstrings tight, her towel clamped under her arm. Her legs were bare, pocked with goosebumps. Her freckled nose wrinkled. "You survived."

David coughed. "You're swimming today? Are you out of your mind?"

"Every day," she said. "You smoke?"

"Once in a while." He stubbed it out. "Thought it might keep me warm."

She picked the butt out of the sand. "If I catch you leaving one of these here, I'll backhand you. Understand?"

"Sorry." He stuffed it into a pocket.

"Have a nightmare again?"

He nodded.

She pulled the sweatshirt off over her head.

He looked away, feeling like he'd seen something he shouldn't.

"Come swimming. You'll feel better."

He rolled his trouser-cuffs past his knees and stepped into an onrushing wave. The water was freezing. It reached up his shins. A wave approached at the brink of crashing. He braced himself, but when it hit the sand beneath him rolled like the deck of a ship, the undertow heaved at his ankles, and he stumbled, windmilling his arms. He caught himself — barely — and fled to the safety of the shore.

Kate was trying to hide her laughter. He leaned over, dizzy, hands to his knees. "How do you stand it?"

"It's all in the way you go in. Test the water first and you'll never make it. Run. Run from the top of the beach, as fast as you can, so there's no way to stop. Hit the wave head-on, before it breaks. You'll hardly feel it."

"Ha," he said. "Too late."

She ran and dove, slipping into the face of a breaker. She swam straight out, a small, dark head and a trail of foam against the green. She went on and on. He imagined her never turning — just swimming away, out alone across the ocean.

She dove under. The line of foam sank away.

She burst from the waves two strokes from shore and climbed out, breath ragged. "You don't know what you're missing." She put on her sweatshirt and towel, squeezed the water from her hair. "Okay. I'm ready."

"For what?"

"What did you dream?"

He took a breath.

"I was sitting in the chair in our cabin on the Gray Seal. The storm was raging. It was dark. I couldn't sleep. There were birds on the wind, black birds with white wings. I could hear the sailors up on deck, calling the captain, over and over. I kept looking at Eleanora, hoping she'd wake up, so I could…"

"Then I looked and she was gone.

"I went to the captain's cabin. It was empty. I went up on deck. There was no one at the helm. I tried to get to it, to steer, but the deck kept changing. Every sailor I passed said she was safe in her cabin, asleep. But they hadn't seen the captain. I watched them all get blown off the ship into the storm.

"For a while, I steered. Then I realized they were right. I'd fallen asleep in the chair. She was safe in bed beside me. Which meant we were the last ones left. If I wasn't steering, no one was. The ship was sinking. I had to save her.

"Then the birds were screaming, and water was coming in the portal, and I fell out of the chair."

David shuddered and got up. He might have gone south, but she stopped him. "David! For crying out loud. It's just a dream. It's just a… chair.

"Come on. I'll buy you breakfast."

She'd had to run home for a pair of her father's sandals before the donut shop would allow David in. They sat in a corner. He stared out the window, his hands in his lap, feeling like the biggest asshole the world had ever known.

"I'm throwing a party tonight for my friends," she was saying. "I'd like you to meet them. It might be good for you, you know. If you want, you can always go back to your chair."

"Sure," he said. "Okay."

She'd hung the garden lattices with strings of yellow lights. The painting was propped on a windowsill. The crescent moon gleamed in a cloud-barred sky; a red star clung close to its tip. Inside, trip-hop thrummed from the stereo.

David squatted on the stoop, nursing a glass that once had held cranberry juice and ice. He kept topping off from the flask, until it was more like whiskey and water. People milled about the porch and garden; her friends were bartenders and waitresses, at least until the tourist season's end. They were nice enough.

Kate wore a set of her mother's pearls, a black dress, and flip-flops. Her hair still clung to itself like she'd just emerged from the ocean. She looked the hostess. She wasn't Eleanora.

She sat with three friends at a patio table, legs crossed, drinking wine. The centerpiece was an abandoned bird's nest: dead grass, fishing line and seaweed. An oil lamp rose out of it. They leaned close, faces warm, sharing secrets. Everyone at this party seemed to be. By some trick of the storm's remnant breeze, he heard them.

"Who is he?"

"I met him on the beach."

One of them laughed. Another shook her head.

Silly, stubborn Kate, their faces said. Still digging washed-up treasures from the sand. Still trying to fix them.

He thought of the old couple that had passed him on the beach: older than the flood, still holding hands. No doubt they told their great-grandchildren a story: a hundred years ago a girl and a boy met at the ocean. They watched the sailboats pass and fell in love. They still walk to the ocean every day. False fairytales of love the painful truths of which they'd lied about until they forgot them, perpetuating hopes in the hearts of the young for things that could never be. The lifeguard and the girl in the bikini, their idiotic whispers.

Eleanora, naked, skin silken white, fucking another man by the light of the star-dogged moon.

David stood and dropped his glass among the tomatoes. He brushed past Kate and her friends and out of the garden, walking fast. A chair scraped against flagstone. Footsteps closed on him as he walked down the driveway.

In the street, Kate caught him by the arm. Pearls against her throat. "What are you doing?"

"I can't sit here anymore."

"You've made up your mind?"

He blinked. "No."

"You're going back."

"No," he said, too loud. The chatter of the party died away. "But I'm not staying here."

She let go of his arm. "You want to leave, fine. Go sleep it off in your chair."

"I won't fall in love with you, Kate."

Kate clenched her jaw. She made a fist.

The world went black, like the beam from the Nauset Light. The Milky Way shone behind his eyelids. It hurt. Just for a moment, it hurt him worse than Eleanora.

Someone from the party cheered.

The world returned. He wiped his mouth with the back of a hand and walked towards the beach.

From the foot of the wooden stairs he went north. The cold sand scrunched beneath his feet. He made it a hundred strides.

Behind him the driftwood chair cast its shadow across sawgrass-covered dunes.

He ran back, breath burning in his throat. He grabbed the chair by its legs, the sea-smoothed wood like skin against his fingers, so waterlogged and heavy it felt like lifting a human corpse. He gritted his teeth. With a sound that began as a grunt and turned to a howl, he ran the three strides to the water's edge and hurled the chair over the breakers. It bobbed, then disappeared.

David sat in the chair in a tiny rowboat in the dark, with Eleanora at the oars. The hull of the Gray Seal slipped past them to the cries of birds.

"What happened to the captain?"

Eleanora took an ax from the folds of her nightgown. She raised it above her head and swung it down, striking the keel. A crack gaped in the wood. She swung again. The crack became a hole. Black water spouted up. The ax fell through and disappeared. Through the hole in the boat, the dream-ocean drank them down.

It wasn't as cold as the real one. The depths turned green as they descended. Eleanora's lips burned red; her hair in the currents curled like weeds; her skin was alabaster.

At the bed of the sea the captain awaited, pistol in his hand. Fish had eaten away his flesh. His bones were jet-black, patched with mold.

David choked; he awoke in the sand. Beyond the surf the sea rolled smooth as glass. There was no sign of the chair.

He stripped off his clothes. He ran at the water. Icy spray leapt up from the surf at the impact of his feet. He didn't feel it. A breaker reared, its head flecked white. The dawn glowed through its surface. He sucked in breath and dove.

All noise and feeling disappeared. He floated, suspended. He opened his eyes to the salt. He couldn't see the chair or Eleanora.

His head broke free. He breathed. He gazed across the expanse of green-gray where once, perhaps, a pleasure ship had crashed in a spirit gale while its captain dreamed below decks of his own Eleanora.

He looked back at the shore. Kate's easel stood there.

He kicked and pumped his arms and found land underneath him. He clawed his way out and stood dripping.

The Gray Seal, the ship, was where it should be — though there was no sign of red hair. She'd blotted out the seal and replaced it with a man: seated, brooding in the chair.

Leading north from the easel, footprints marred the dew-damp sand. The middle toe was a little too long. He saw the track falter, hesitate, turn back, and go on.
