Lovelle likes to take off everything. One moment, she is fully-clothed; the next, she is a dry ghost in need of lotion. Sarita, my wife, prefers to unravel herself in front of my judging eyes, much like a ball of yarn. Perhaps this is something she has learned from watching Bollywood porn.

Lovelle smells of rice flour and smoke derived from Gitane cigarettes. Sarita smells of jasmine and burritos stuffed with cumin. When I am with one, I think of the other. When I am asleep, I think of a third, but I am unsure yet who the third will be. But I am certain that there will be a third.

I am in the bathroom. The water is running in the sink. I examine the tag on my shirt. It reads, "Made in Colombia. Do Not Eat Today." I put on my glasses and read it again. The tag reads the same. I place the tag under water, and the words seem abnormally large against my small, weak hands. It does not wash away like I want.

"Lovelle, please come read this," I ask. She slithers out of bed, the way one would imagine a snail leaving its shell if it must. She comes to the bathroom and leans her head against the door frame, her bright red hair offering (sometimes) a much needed distraction from her face.

"What is it, darling? I am not in the mood for it in the bathroom." Her voice is unnaturally saucy, sans cherry. She leans over the sink, and I feel one of her nipples grazing my arm, the way a dog grazes a piece of hotdog. I shake it off as I will come to shake off Sarita's "I'm home" kiss.

"Can you read this tag?" I ask.

"No," she says. She flips her hair and it catches me in the eye. If she could, she would exist as a bubble, allowing the world to see her, but not touching or changing the world in any way. But she cannot. Ugliness is attractive. My wife doesn't understand that.

"Please, Lovelle, it's important to me." The ugly also wield power. Many of them don't know this yet, but she does.

Lovelle does not answer, but goes back to my bed. She looks like a snow angel, but without the snow and without the look of innocence.

I begin to go through the rest of my closet. I find an old corduroy shirt that Sarita gave me for a birthday. She always gifts me with shirts. I loathe her lack of creativity, but also appreciate her predictable nature. Comfort can be found in patterns. I know this year that she will get me a linen shirt; she is making her way through the fabric rainbow. Next year will be flannel.

I take the corduroy shirt off its hanger and examine the label. It reads, "Made in the USA. Hand and Fist Are Not the Same." I look at my hand, and then I look at it again as a fist. Sarita doesn't sew. Neither does Lovelle. I've always wanted to be with a seamstress. I imagine her nimble fingers rubbing my body at equal intervals, the way a carefully placed stitch appears on a shirt sleeve. Perhaps she will be my third.

"Lovelle, where is your blouse?"

"Boris, when are you going to leave your wife?"

When she doesn't want to answer a question of mine, she responds with a question of her own. Most often, they are questions about my wife. When are you going to kiss her again? Do you think of me when you are with her? Does she wash her behind the way you do? Neither of us gets the answer we desire, but I am not so sure we are looking for an answer.

"Please don't call me Boris." I prefer people to call me "mister," "sir," or any other masculine term of anonymity. I was born with a name that people often mistake for being European. When I introduce myself, they are confused, but it isn't difficult to confuse most people. Confusion leads to questions, intruding ones. I find by smiling and showing people my crooked teeth, they usually go away. Who said smiling was the universal symbol of friendship? Perhaps a dentist.

I crawl underneath the bed and find her blouse. Today she has worn the white one with the pink hearts on the bosom. She knows I cannot tolerate the shirt. Sarita's favorite color is white, and early on, before I caught on to Lovelle's manipulations, I had answered her question about Sarita's preferred color of choice. Now, I cannot get Lovelle to stop wearing the saintly shade. Being with her feels as though I am with an Indian widow. The association at first turned me on, but now it makes me tired.

I read the tag, and it says, "Made in India. Leave Her Now."

"Wake up, please," I whine. I hate to be so obsequious, especially with someone as ugly as she is, but I have learned that that is the only way to get a response from her. She has already fallen asleep, another characteristic I despise in her. She dreams as soon as her head touches the pillow. I must count sheep. Lately I've been counting the number of women I've slept with since I've come to this country.

I stare at her and shake her bottom as though I am fluffing a sofa cushion. I wonder sometimes if she can detect my contempt for her. I cannot get away though. She is oddly in control of the relationship, although I am the one who laid claim to her first. Her careless and at times indifferent attitude toward me and life in general is intoxicating. I want to make her like life more. Perhaps that is why I stay, but I am a man after all. I probably stay because she is free and easy to maintain, unlike the plants that my wife keeps in the house.

"What is it, sir?" She itches at her eyes, and I see that they already have sleep in them.

"Come," I say. I pull off her underwear, and she coos like a pigeon trapped in the palm of my hand.

"I will at this rate," she says. I push her away from my face. I turn the tag over on her panties, and it reads, "Made in China. Not Free."

I realize that I need to get away from her to think. My favorite place to meditate is in the laundry room of the basement of my apartment building. The drone of the ancient machines reminds me of a prehistoric time. I imagine the only sounds the cavemen heard were each other's animalistic screams and the thunder in the sky. When I sit on the dryer, I close my eyes and I can transcend to that place, where women were not complicated and men got what they wanted when they wanted.

As I close the door, I see Lovelle's face buried in my favorite pillow. She doesn't drool, but my picture of her would almost be better if she did. When I get to the basement, I find that both machines are occupied. On top of the washing machine, someone has left her laundry basket. It is pink, not unlike the parts of Lovelle that I do really love. Out of curiosity, I open the lid and take out a scalloped bra. It is a 32A, and I know I have never seen any woman as small as that in my building before.

I sit and wait for the petite woman in the laundry room, certain that she will provide me with some sort of guidance. They rarely ever disappoint me. My best friend is a Napoleon figure. He is an asshole, but clever as a deceptive Leprechaun. This new woman will tell me if I am delusional and if Lovelle is the ugliest woman she's ever seen, first to my own wife. I could start an army of the women I've fucked: the ugly army.

Burfi finally arrives. I am not sure of her name, but that is what I think of when I see her — a coconut dessert bar topped with flakes of sugar and pistachio nuts.

"Burfi, you're finally here," I say.

"Sebastian?" she asks. She too has sleep in her eyes.

"Who's Sebastian? Is that your father?" She looks young enough to still have a father. My wife's father died from complications related to diabetes, bloated on sugar cane juice given to him by his malicious servants in India. Lovelle's father abused her as a child; so she'd emancipated herself at age 16 and never returned. I heard the same story from so many women I couldn't even be empathic anymore. I felt like a bad person, but emotions dull over time.

"Sorry, you looked like someone I knew once. That I had met online."

"Online?"

"Never mind."

We stand in silence, I admiring the carpet of tattoos that cover her body.

"Should I acquire a third or get rid of one?" I ask her. A woman with artwork on her body should know something about taking lovers.

"I don't know what you're talking about."

"Women."

She takes a second as if debating with herself on whether to answer. "Do they know about each other?"

"No, why would they?"

"Are they beautiful?"

"No. I don't think so. But beautiful women — they cost more." I remember the bus conductor in Chennai, back when the city was still called Madras and back when I was still in college with no driver and no bicycle. The only solace was Radha, the bus lady; her name suited her perfectly. I could've traced her figure in circles only; she was that geometric. When men tried to make advances at her or whistle, she'd flirt with them, collecting their names and addresses and promising to pay a visit. Then, at least how the rumor went, she'd send her brothers — all five of them like the mythical Pandavas from the Mahabharata — and assault the perverts.

"Are they nice people?"

"What does that have to do with it?" I ask.

"Don't you care if you hurt their feelings?"

"Oh no. They have been through far worse. I could never hurt them the way they have already been hurt. They are impenetrable." Sometimes I want to though, but I know especially with Lovelle, I cannot. She is much too strong for me. Sarita would just beat me with a deep fryer.

She stops talking, and I know I have offended her. I used to care, but I don't anymore. I stare at her, hoping to provoke her into a response or some sort of outburst, but she holds her calm. After the dryer makes a beep, she collects her belongings and scatters. I find that she has left the bra behind. Before I tuck it inside my shirt, I read the tag. It says, "Made in Honduras. Listen."

When I return to my apartment, Lovelle is missing. My wife has left a message on the answering machine. It says, "I'm ovulating." Her syrupy voice gives me the chills. I said yes to her demands because the miscarriage rate is nearly 13%. I have always been good with odds.

Lovelle returns with her arms filled with paper sacks of flour and greased newspaper covering tins of freshly churned butter.

"I'm going to make you a cake, sir," she says, scooping out the flour with her bare hands.

"What is the occasion?"

"Life," she says, and I know she has heard the message.

"I love you, Lovelle," I say, hoping to distract her. I don't believe that I am really in love with her, but she knows that we sometimes must play these games, where I am the devoted boyfriend and she is the beautiful girlfriend. Smart men wouldn't waste their energies on affairs; they'd tackle the world's problems instead. Unfortunately, as social creatures, we cannot escape the habits of lesser men.

"Oh, sir," she says. She smears flour on her bottom and shakes it in front of my face as though rattling a toy in front of a small child. She whips the batter into a frothy yellow cream and pours it into delicate aluminum cups. She sticks the tray into the oven, and I realize that my oven has been on all night.

"Come eat," she says.

"They are not ready, you just put them in the oven." She places her pinky finger onto my lips and quiets me with her coral-colored eyes. She has a paper bag, and from inside she produces a perfect slice of chocolate cake.

"For me?" I ask. My stomach gurgles the way my car sometimes does after a tune-up. I grab Lovelle and start to make love to her among the dirty dishes. My wife will be home soon.

"Boris, eat your cake!" She screams the way she does when I have done something good. That is so very rare with her. I take the cake and eat it with my hands. My mother always used to scold me for eating with my fingers even though that's what Indians do. We were Indians trying to be British back then, but even she couldn't stop me now. She was dead.

"I am sleepy, Lovelle. Will you come rest with me?" My full stomach has made me tired. I hear the key turn in the lock. Sarita already?

"Lovelle?" She just smiles and closes her eyes. I force myself awake and see Sarita enter the apartment. The two women smile at each other, and before I drift to sleep, I read the tag on her shirt again. It says, "Good Night." I try to reach for Lovelle's hand, and then Sarita's, but I cannot find them. Instead, I can hear them laughing, both voices so loud that I cover my ears and drown myself in sound.
