I

One moonless June night in the year 19__, a man named Juan Hernandez stole into the house of his former employer, the wealthy and ruthless landowner Páez, and left with his pockets stuffed with pesos and jewelery belonging to Páez's late wife. Still angry at losing his job that same day, and ashamed because rather than break the news to his wife he had squandered the last of his wages on drink, Juan had grown bitter towards Páez, with his land and his fortune and his house as grand as a palace, and in his drunkenness his mind became clouded with thoughts of revenge. That morning, when he was summoned to the Foreman's office only to be told that he no longer had a job, Juan had overheard one of the gauchos mention that Páez planned to stay overnight in the city; and so, as he neared the property sometime between one and one thirty in the morning, thoughts of revenge blossomed into thoughts of robbery.

And he was reckless, crossing the wide lawn to reach the house, then marching across the veranda in his boots; yet no one called out to him, and no lights bloomed behind any of the windows. Drunk as he was, Juan believed himself blessed; the first door he tried was unlocked, and the first drawer he rifled yielded nearly thirty pesos in loose coins and bills.

But Páez had a fortune, didn't he? Everyone knew that. So Juan, too far gone to remember that actions have consequences, pocketed the money and made his way upstairs. He headed straight for the large, ornate doors at the end of the first floor landing, opened those doors, and slipped inside. There in Páez's grand and spacious private suite, Juan quickly uncovered the jewelery, rings and pearls and a slender silver crucifix on a slender silver chain, in a carved teak box kept in a bureau beside the bed. Juan took the jewelery, and left the box, open and empty, like an insult, on the floor.

No one saw him, no one heard him. He was a ghost (he told himself), he was looked upon and found worthy by God.

II

Returning home late the next morning Páez was told of the robbery, and within an hour had sent fifteen well armed men to track down the thief. Their orders were simple: find him, kill him in any manner that pleased them, and return the stolen jewelery. If the thief had not already spent the money, they were welcome to divide it among themselves.

By this time Juan was wide awake and sober, crouched in a hollow left by a fallen tree in the hills above his village. He was desperately trying to convince himself that last night had been a dream, but the weight of the lie was there in his pockets, undeniable. His first thought was to run; his second, of his family. Juan pictured his wife Cristina and his young son Ramón, and his fear was real, but as he made his way home a voice as cold and alluring as the Devil's began to whisper run, now, while you still can. The whisper became insistent once he entered his house and found it empty; they've gone to search for you, it said, this is your chance.

Juan knew, then, that he would run, before his wife and son returned. He emptied his pockets, separating the money from the jewellery. The money he kept, the pearls and the silver and the gold he wrapped in a scrap of cloth, hiding the bundle in Cristina's sewing box. She would find it (the whisper assured him of this) and choose to sell it or return it to Páez herself. Either way all would be well, the whisper told him, now go. Run!

And so Juan Hernandez ran.

Páez's men had already picked up rumours of a drunk sacked from his job in the fields the previous day, and had beaten a name out of one of the workers. Luck was with them; before they could check Juan's house, a boy on his way to fish at the river told them he had spotted a man fleeing towards the hills east of the village. They caught up with Juan less than an hour later, terrified and too exhausted to fight. They took the money, and tortured him before cutting his throat (in one fanciful version of the story Páez himself appeared in the form of a serpent, and killed Juan by first consuming his heart, then his soul). But Juan, believing he could do this one last good thing for his family, never revealed where the jewellery was hidden. Páez's men knew they could not return without it; they rode back to the village, arriving soon after Juan's wife and son had returned from their fruitless search.

It all happened so quickly. Ramón was sleeping, worn out by the search for his Papa, but was soon woken by his mother's screams. The gunshot that ended her life still rang like thunder in his ears as he scrambled from his bed and burst into the room. He saw grinning shadows, and something faceless that wore his mother's dress, before a final explosion ripped the world away from him in a flash of blinding light. Páez's men tore the house apart, and soon enough found the jewellery where Juan had hidden it.

Pleased with their day's work, they left the bodies of Juan's wife and son where they lay.

III

Páez only learnt of Ramón's fate a month later, but the villages surrounding his estate had been buzzing with the news for weeks. The morning following his parents' deaths, Ramón had been found wandering near the river, blood still leaking from the bullet wound above his right eye. Clearly in shock, he whispered about lightening in a voice witnesses say was terrifying in its beauty. He was quickly taken to his grandmother in the next village, and despite the tragedy, the news seemed to be good; the bullet, thanks either to luck or the gunman's ineptitude, instead of killing the boy, had left him blind. When Páez heard this, instead of ordering Ramón to be killed, he sent for the man who had fired the bullet, and shot him instead.

Physically, Ramón appeared to adapt to his sightlessness quickly. Still, his grandmother feared for him. Ramón slept little, and poorly, complaining of 'dreams'. Lightning appeared under clear skies, even under his grandmother's roof, and this lightning spoke to Ramón in his dead mother's voice. Often he was unable to make sense of her words, but sometimes she spoke of others, and asked Ramón to let his grandmother know that she had found peace. If Juan ever appeared to Ramón in his dreams, the boy did not mention it.

He was not frightened by the dreams, but they made his eyes ache, and brought headaches none of his grandmother's remedies could ease. She had faith, but she was not superstitious, and more than anything she feared that her grandson was slowly losing his mind.

IV

When strange reports of a blind boy who could speak to the dead eventually reached Páez, he had forgotten the thief Juan and his family, and had to be reminded of the hand he had played in their fates. Publicly, Páez shrugged off the tales as nothing more than village gossip. Privately, they came to haunt him, the way dreams of power and wealth had once haunted him, the way his wife's death in childbirth had haunted him these past seven years. The jewellery Juan had stolen had belonged to Páez's wife, and was precious to Páez for that reason alone. Her ghost had been with him since the night of her death, but it was a ghost he could not see or hear or speak to, and so he held her jewellery instead, or laid her wedding gown across his bed, as if his memory of the woman who had worn it could animate it for one final dance. No one knew of this; Páez never spoke his wife's name, and as far as anyone was concerned she no longer even entered his thoughts.

A week after first hearing Ramón's story, Páez sent a man to the village to watch and listen and return with information Páez could rely on. The spy returned after two days, with the news that he had not only seen and spoken to the boy, but actually recognised him; he had been part of the posse sent after Juan, there when Cristina was murdered and her son shot and left for dead. As to the boy's powers, everyone the spy had spoken to confirmed the story, as many exhibiting belief as scepticism. The spy had spoken to Ramón himself at Cristina's gravesite, and heedless of any risk the boy had admitted that yes, he often saw and spoke to his dead mother in his dreams.

Páez found no sleep that night, nor the next. On the third day after the spy's return, Páez was seen, just after dawn, riding east in the direction of Ramón's village. Once there he was given direction to Ramón's home, spending no more than fifteen minutes inside (though he was seen to step outside at one point, taking a few moments to puff contentedly on a cigarillo). When he left the village the blind boy rode with him, and many of those who stood by to watch their departure swore that it was the first time any of them had ever seen Páez smile.

V

Ramón's grandmother refused to speak of the events of that day, but years later Ramón himself would tell the story to the daughter of a French general killed, along with her fiancé, in the Great War.

That afternoon in 19__, Páez entered the house unannounced to find Ramón and his grandmother composing a letter to relatives in S__ R_____. All that Ramón knew of their visitor was that he had once employed his father, as he employed a great many men from the nearby villages, but before the ink on the letter had dried he would learn that Páez was also the man responsible for the death of his parents. His grandmother, despite her fear of Páez (and who in that region did not fear him?) knew this already, and it aged her to keep her hatred for Páez out of her voice and away from her eyes.

If Páez picked up on this, he made no comment. He was civil, but spoke with authority, directing his words to the old woman yet glancing constantly at Ramón, who could feel the man's eyes fix on him, like hunger. And he lied superbly, explaining that Ramón's tragic story had touched his heart, even adding the spice of truth by saying that he, Páez, had lain awake night after night, dwelling on it. He had come today to make them an offer: he would take the boy into his home, feed him and clothe him, provide him with an education and one day a job. His status as Páez's 'adopted' son would ensure wealth, and respect. All Páez expected in return was for Ramón to honour Páez's good name.

It was at this point that Páez stepped outside, allowing Ramón and his grandmother a few moments to discuss it. The instant they were alone, the old woman leant forward and whispered into Ramón's ear: "This man is the Devil Páez. He murdered your mother and father. Go with him, child. Become his son. When you are old enough, or when you are strong enough, take your revenge on him, which will be my revenge also."

Before Ramón could respond, his grandmother called to Páez, and told him that they accepted his offer. Páez betrayed no emotion, simply asking Ramón to gather together whatever possessions he wished to take with him. As soon as Ramón left the room Páez tossed a bag of gold coins onto the table. The smack of wealth onto wood was final: the old woman was never to see or speak to her grandson again.

VI

Those first months in Páez's house were difficult and confusing. It took Ramón weeks to learn the layout of the many rooms, which to him all felt as vast as cathedrals, and to get used to the staircase which curved up beyond the height of the trees he used to climb when he still had his sight. On his first morning there, Páez introduced him to Louis, Páez's own majordomo, who would answer any questions Ramón had, and act as his guide. But Ramón was wary of calling on him. His grandmother's revelation was a stone in his heart, his hatred for Páez new and fragile; relying on Páez's servant for anything felt like a betrayal of his family. So Ramón constantly bumped into furniture, or tripped on the edges of rugs, and more than once he lost his balance on the staircase. Yet Louis was there to help him up after every stumble and fall, as if he had been watching Ramón all the time, so silent even Ramón's already keen hearing failed to detect him. But more than anything Ramón quickly realised that Louis was a good man, and loyal, and he treated Ramón without pity.

Meanwhile Ramón assumed that Páez's interest in him was connected to the murder of his parents, yet if that was the case, why didn't Páez simply have him killed? Now that Ramón was living under his roof, Páez as good as ignored him, and only made idle conversation when the met for dinner each evening. Ramón quickly came to recognise his benefactor's firm but languid footsteps and the stink of his cigarillos, and each time he approached Ramón expected something more than the simple 'good evening' or 'how are you today, Ramón?' Páez invariably greeted him with. Ramón felt powerless in his presence, and often he could find nothing to say in return beyond a hurried acknowledgement that he was well. Each night he asked himself, how can I do it? How can I kill this man?

And he continued to dream. Not as frequently as before, but the dreams, and the headaches that followed them, like venom burning behind his eyes, had lost none of their potency. He spoke of the dreams to no one, and Páez, if he knew, never once alluded to them.

VII

Ramón had been at the house for two months. One night he returned from a walk in the gardens to find Páez waiting for him in his room. Ramón felt his presence, although for long moments Páez did not speak. The sound of his breathing told Ramón he was standing across the room from the bed, where Ramón knew there was a window.

When Páez did finally speak Ramón was immediately aware of a change in his voice, the strain of something Páez clearly found it difficult to contain. He said, "I was married once, did you know that? My wife … she was an angel. We had been together for less than one year when she died."

That was all. Páez left the room, closing the door behind him as if to seal away the shameful fact of his admission. Thinking about what Páez had just told him, Ramón lay down on his bed without undressing. He understood now what it was Páez required of him, and he realised, with no pleasure but with an immediate lifting of the stone from his heart, what it was he must do.

VIII

Over the next week, which saw Ramón's thirteenth birthday, Páez began to spend more time with him, and gradually a clearer picture of his late wife emerged. Her name had been Eva, the daughter of a landowner who had once been Páez's enemy, until Páez offered a lucrative partnership that hinged on Eva's hand in marriage. The price was a considerable acreage of prime grazing land, together with the fifteen finest horses from Páez's stables, but Páez would willingly have paid ten times as much. Eva, he told Ramón, as they walked together in the garden, surrounded by the scent of jasmine and the chirping of cicadas … Eva was exquisite, and despite the difference in their ages Páez confessed he often felt like a clumsy, tongue-tied child in her presence. She did not oppose the marriage, though privately Ramón wondered if this was more out of love for her father than for the man she was to wed. The year they spent together, with Eva's voice filling the house, and her touch everywhere, was the happiest of Páez's life. The prospect of a son – and Eva insisted that it would be a son – made it all the happier.

But the night of the birth ended in tragedy. Eva's labour lasted thirteen hours, and the son they were finally forced to cut out of her was tiny, ashen, and dead. Eva outlived him by three hours, before grief and blood loss overcame her. Páez, in another part of the house, knew as each hour passed that his happiness was slipping away from him, and spent much of that time simply staring at his hands, marvelling that he was powerless to stop it. When the doctor brought him the news Páez held up his hands and said, simply, "look at these." Then he told Louis to bury his wife and his child, and to this day had never once asked to see their graves.

Some of these details Ramón learnt from Louis, who spoke of that night as if Eva had been his daughter, or Páez his son. And it was to Louis that Ramón addressed a question that had been troubling him for days, unable to prevent it from corroding his resolve: "Did Páez's heart die that night?" Without pause Louis told him, "No. He has no heart. Eva died before she could work that magic."

IX

The first time, Páez brought him a photograph.

"She is smiling in this one," he told Ramón, handing him something heavy and square in shape, its weight explained by what Ramón imagined was an expensive gold frame. Trying to picture Eva's face he could only summon an image of his mother, then images, a flood of them that swept him away. He heard Páez cross the room and sit down, then the small explosion of a match as he lit a cigarillo. The ticking of the clock. Ramón moved his fingers across the photograph, but it told him nothing, and when over twenty minutes had passed without result Páez left the room, saying nothing as he lifted the photograph from Ramón's trembling hands.

X

The following night it was the jewellery which brought not Eva but Ramón's father Juan, indistinct but leaking a foul dark substance Ramón felt as grief, or shame, or some mixture of both; he could not speak, or lift his eyes, but his pain washed through Ramón, thick as tar. When Páez's voice finally reached him, Ramón realised he must have been speaking to him for some time, asking not "Is something wrong?" but "Is she here? Is it Eva?"

XI

Two nights later, Páez brought Eva's wedding dress.

Ramón knew before he touched it that something would happen. The air above the bed where the dress was laid – Páez crossed the empty sleeves over the flat bodice, so they framed the créme silk rose sewn onto the neckline – was agitated, fever-hot, and the room quickly filled with the scent of acacia. Tonight Páez stood by his side to watch, his breath sweet with the tequila he'd been drinking since early afternoon. Ramón, guided by instinct, allowed his hands to drift through the warm air above the dress, his fingers splayed, millimetres shy of touching it, and he thought I am a child, I am an orphan, I am blind, as if these concepts were new to him, vast and deep and impenetrable. His grandmother's words – he pictured her kneeling in prayer as she spoke them – were still a stone in his heart, but his heart was a song his mother used to sing, and her smile, and the love in her eyes as she gazed down at him.

Instantly the lightning came, filling the room by burning the air out of it, so in that moment Ramón could not breathe; and from out of the lightning came a woman as beautiful as Cristina, as naked as a lover. Behind her others shimmered, looking on with ravenous eyes.

"Ramón?" Páez's voice, compressed by need, was like a child's.

"Eva," Ramón said. She came to him. She reached out and framed his face in her hands, and pressed her lips against his, and the kiss was her story but it was his story too. She was blinded by the bullet meant to kill her as he felt the surgeon's knife slice open his belly, she was scared and alone, the world screaming at them, and his life poured out onto silk sheets Páez had ordered all the way from Paris. When she broke the kiss Ramón could hear Páez weeping. He spoke her name, and gasped as if he could see her turn, watched as Ramón watched Eva open her arms to embrace her widow. But it was a different kiss she greeted him with, Páez twisted and bucked, his bowels loosened, and strand by strand his black hair dulled to grey. The kiss was endless, a lifetime, but Ramón looked on, his dead eyes leaking tears.

XII

It was Louis found them. Ramón, sitting on the floor beneath the window, heard the old servant enter the room, pause, and then move towards the bed without speaking. Time passed. Eventually Ramón asked, "Is he dead?"

"Not yet," Louis told him. He may have used a knife, or suffocated the moaning leaking thing that was Páez with a pillow; however he finished it, he did it noiselessly.

Ramón stood up. With his back to the window he could feel the sun, but he already knew that it was morning.

Louis sighed. "I know what he did to your family," he told Ramón. "But I have my duty. I can give you a day. At dawn tomorrow, I will come after you."

Ramón nodded. "Will you do something for me before I leave?"

"If I can."

"Take me to Eva's grave."

XIII

Louis had buried mother and child beneath a tree at the edge of Páez's garden, where Eva had liked to walk. As Louis watched, Ramón took something from his pocket, and kneeling carefully, placed the object on the ground above Eva's bones. Then he straightened and walked away, following the river east towards the hills and the world beyond them.

Louis thought long and hard before walking to the grave to see what it was Ramón had left there. He stared down at the single créme silk rose, and said a prayer, and then leaving it behind with Ramón's blessing he returned to the house. True to his word at dawn the next day he set out to search for Ramón.

As those who still like to tell this story are fond of saying, even a blind man could see that he did not look very hard.
