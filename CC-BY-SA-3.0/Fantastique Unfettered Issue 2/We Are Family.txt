Bella rushed into the bedroom, struck a match, lit the incense in the brass, Isis-shaped holder, then fell back onto the bed, hands on her belly, her long white cotton skirt fanning out on the bedspread, her black braid an exclamation point on the pillow.

"My mother never loved me," she said to the ceiling. "What if I can't love my baby? Ever since I was a little girl playing with dolls I've wanted a baby, but now I'm scared. Freddy."

Freddy, leaning in the doorway, rubbed her hand over her crew cut.

"You're nuts."

Bella patted the bedspread and Freddy joined Bella, heaving her onto her large bosom and hugging both arms around Bella's shoulders.

"You love me, even if my mother doesn't," Bella said.

"'Calling Doctor Freud.'"

I don't believe she referred to me. I'm just a seven inch tall Freud Action Figure. A gag gift — nasty term — from Freddy to Bella, a comment on Bella's navel-gazing — another nasty term. From my place on the table on a dust-darkened circle of lace, I looked across at the bed, at Bella's pale bare feet and Freddy's in thick rag wool socks, the foreshortened lengths of their bodies, to the carved Mexican headboard to which Freddy sometimes tied Bella's wrists with soft, gauzy scarfs. I have a new home, now, one I prefer. I'm glad I no longer stand watch near the foot of their bed.

How did the real Freud feel about lesbians? I've no idea. My grasp on history is loose. (Though I know more than enough about the cult of Isis.) After all, I'm not a doctor, I'm an Action Figure, though back then I saw as little action as the purple vibrator to my right on the doily. It was two inches taller than I, but we shared a similar shape. However, the conceited brass Isis incense burner to my left was all curves; bulging breasts, belly and thighs. Isis considered herself a fertility figure and often chanted prayers to herself, but I don't recall if she was doing so on that particular day.

From her pillow, Bella broke the silence. "Are we just going to cuddle?"

"You don't want to shake it loose." Freddy sat up on the creaking bed. "Got to get back to work, anyhow. Don't brood about your mom. I'll bring home dinner."

"Sal's pizza?"

"You're not eating that crap."

"Bossy."

After Freddy left, the motorcycle roar fading, Bella sat up and padded out of the room. Moments later, I heard the back door slap shut.

"She forgot to blow you out," I complained to Isis. "She'll burn the house down and us in it."

"Stop your fussing, old man."

Later, Bella returned with a vase of roses she set on the table behind Isis, frowning at the trail of gray ash that lay over the doily.

"She might dust."

"Hush." Isis said. "I'm sensing a bad aura. Oh, dear!"

At that moment, Bella's hand went to her belly. Her face froze, then crumpled. "Not again!" She ran to the bathroom, sobbing. Isis began to sob, too.

I wanted to comment that she was a very poor fertility goddess.

When Bella and Freddy returned from the hospital, Bella went to bed in a flannel nightgown buttoned to her chin, her black hair lose.

"Will you let people know? Call my mom?"

"I'll take care of everything."

Freddy brought Bella a mug of tea, magazines, extra pillows, thumping around the room.

"I don't know if I can go though with it again," Bella said, over her tea.

"Sure you can, when you're stronger."

"What if I can't have a baby — ever? What if I'm being punished for resenting my mother for not loving me?"

"Don't talk so much. Rest."

I could've told you Bella wouldn't stay in bed, though. Soon she sat by the window or paced the narrow space between bed and closet. Once, standing listlessly, she held a pillow against her stomach and studied herself in the mirror with hope in her eyes and despair in the set of her mouth. Then she knelt before Isis to light yet another incense stick.

"Help me make a family."

Next morning, she woke first and lay, eyes open, beside Freddy. Twice, she touched Freddy's round shoulder, finally rousing her with a kiss on the cheek. Freddy's wide mouth stretched into a smile.

"S'up? You look better this morning."

"I am. I had a thought, maybe a dream." She raised herself on an elbow, her face close to Freddy's. "You could try."

"Me! But — you always wanted to have a baby."

"I want a family. Please consider it?"

Freddy closed her eyes. "Brenda wanted a family."

"That's so sad."

"After she got sick she said she regretted waiting. She really wanted a baby."

"And I really want one, too." Bella sat up in bed, pressing her palms together, beseeching.

"And I want to make you happy."

"I love you," Bella said. "We're so great together."

"When Brenda died, I thought I'd never find someone new to love."

"But you did. Me." Bella pressed her hands to her heart, her hair flowing over her shoulders.

"With that convertible-driving redhead. Finding someone to love has never been your problem, you little slut."

Bella giggled as Freddy reached up, grabbing her wrists roughly, crushing them together in one large hand. They made love, then, and Isis crooned with pleasure, while I wished to turn my bearded face to the wall, or at least close my plastic eyes.

I knew Freddy had done it when she began making extra trips to the bathroom at night.

"I have to pee constantly," she complained in the morning.

"That's normal, that's good."

"My boobs hurt."

"Freddy…" Bella pleaded with her. "You're an amazing person. Once you make up your mind to do something, you go out and do it. You're pregnant, now. You should be happy."

"It feels weird."

Bella's eyes went to the stack of well-used books on her nightstand. Freddy noticed.

"Yeah, yeah, I'll look at your books."

"Educate yourself," Bella said as Freddy left the room. "The one with the black and white photographs is beautiful…"

"Beautiful!" I began, but Isis hushed me.

Alone, Bella sat on the edge of the bed and pulled the book onto her lap, opening it to a marked page.

"There's no justice in the world," Isis said, sniffing. "She's taking it well, but her heart's breaking."

Bella didn't cry, though. In fact, she managed a smile as she looked up from the book, slammed the glossy pages shut, and strode out, her skirt swirling around her ankles.

Weeks passed. Calling it Indian Summer, Bella slipped on sun dresses in the morning and spent little time in the bedroom. With only Isis for company, the hours dragged. In the afternoons, hot sun burned through the westward facing window. One morning, as Freddy, on all fours, searched under the bed for a sock, the sound of Bella retching in the bathroom startled her so that she hit her head on the frame. She stood, hand on bristly hair, as Bella came in, wiping her grinning mouth.

"You're knocked up."

"I'd say it was an accident, but…"

"An accident, yeah. You went to the clinic without me?"

"I knew it'd stick this time. And I was right. I never barfed the other times."

"Is that required?" I asked Isis.

"Pity."

"But two babies at once?" Freddy's forehead wrinkled.

"I always wanted two. This way we'll get past the diapers faster."

Freddy sat on the bed, heavy, silent, pulling on the socks.

"You're thinking, 'Can we afford this?'" Bella asked.

Freddy shrugged.

"This is wonderful news," Isis said to me. "And all my doing. They'll be like twins."

"Don't be stupid," I said back. "Not even siblings."

"In the eyes of the Goddess they are."

"In eyes of the world, they are not."

In time, the babies were born. First, though, more sounds of barfing tormented me. As Bella and Freddy swelled, the bedroom walls drew in. Bella sat on the bed, examining her pale legs for spider veins, while Freddy glared at herself in the mirror.

"I look like a pregnant man. You're lovely, though."

"Except my legs."

Then Freddy disappeared for a day and a half and returned with a bundle she called Noah, with a wrinkled red face under a yellow cap. She nursed him in bed, her huge breasts hanging out, splayed, and changed his diapers at a new changing table, taking a cloth diaper from the stack and dropping the soiled one into a diaper pail lined with a blue plastic bag.

"Christ, I have squat mustard under my nails."

Soon after, Bella brought home a red-faced bundle with a crest of black hair. She called it Nora.

The babies cried together and separately. Sometimes, to stop the clamor, Freddy clamped Nora to her breast; sometimes Bella nursed Noah, too exhausted to differentiate. No one slept more than an hour at a time.

"I feel stupid," Freddy said. "I want my brain back. I want my life back."

Those were grim times; fall, then winter.

"It's freezing out. The babies mustn't get a chill." Bella yanked together the orange velvet curtains Freddy had drawn apart.

Two am and two pm were indistinguishable with the sun shut out, the bedside lamps burning and a portable heater pinging in the corner. In that overheated room, Freddy's upper lip gleamed with sweat. Dirty dishes piled up, and clothes, newspapers, and mail drifted over the bed and down the tumbled pillows to the carpet.

"I hate this mess. I miss my job. What's wrong now?"

Bella bent her head, her braid coiled on her shoulder. "I'm so happy here in our nest, except… you're ruining it."

Gradually, though, the mood in the room lightened. With spring on the horizon, Freddy spread the curtains and even cracked open the window, letting in gusts that rustled newspapers and blew dust bunnies over the floor. Tidying, at last, Bella unburied her flute and played a tune on it for Freddy and the babies. Later, Freddy, kneeling by the bed, performed a puppet show with socks, and the two babies lying in the crooks of Bella's arms, cracked what Bella called their first social smiles, rather than grimaces caused by gas.

Freddy returned to work; Bella cared for the two babies who had outgrown their bassinets and sat in identical carriers on the bed, flopped back, bellies foremost. For a time, they stared at their own hands, splayed like starfish in front of their noses. Later, though, they reached out and joined hands, tiny fingers entwined, and gazed at each other from their carriers. When Bella dressed them, she pulled clothes from a single wicker basket brimming with colorfully patterned t-shirts, pants, socks. When they grew old enough for toys, they played with rattles, mirrors, plush round balls and stacking cups from a single bin. Then Noah began to crawl and Nora screamed with rage, because she could not follow. That was a difficult time, though brief, I suspect, since Nora was determined to keep up with Noah. I can't say for sure when Nora learned to crawl, though, because shortly after Noah became mobile, Bella announced, "Time to baby-proof this place."

Kneeling at the low table, she swept the purple vibrator, Isis, the doily, the silver matchbox, and other knickknacks, including myself, into a cardboard box. The lid came down.

"Goddess help us," Isis said.

The boredom! We objects need a world to watch. Eventually, Isis stopped talking. My thoughts grew darker, then black, then null, until the box joggled, was dragged loudly over the floor, and opened. In the square of light, I saw Bella's face, eyes small and red, freckled nose wet. The box flipped over and I crashed face-down, objects raining on my back. I heard Bella pull a suitcase from under the bed and throw something into it from the mess on the floor.

"Goodbye, old man!" Isis called to me. "Blessings upon you."

Dresser drawers scraped open, wire hangers jangled in the closet, then heavy footsteps — Freddy's boots — came close and stopped by the bed.

"I don't want a husband." Bella sneered the word. "I don't want to be a wife, saying 'we never talk,' stuck here, wondering what's going on out there, why you come home mad." She sounded breathless, as if she'd been talking a long time.

Then Freddy's deeper voice answered more slowly. "I'm stressed from work. You know the new boss sucks. I'll try not to—"

"Shut down? Close me out? We're such clichés!" The suitcase clicked. "I'll pick up Nora from softball. We'll stay with my mom."

"Your mom?"

"Where else can I go? I have no money."

"I give you money."

Bella shouted incoherent syllables from the living room, then the front door banged. I heard Freddy lurching though the house, muttering, rattling keys, then the front door again.

Hours later, footsteps crossed the front porch. As the key turned in the lock, a high-pitched voiced asked, "Where's Nora?"

I couldn't make out Freddy's reply, lost the howls that followed.

Where did Freddy sleep that night? She never came into the bedroom. Perhaps she slept near the boy. In any case, the crying stopped and the darkness was silent. The next day, I heard Noah following Freddy through the house, whining, complaining, persuading in breathless paragraphs that reminded me so much of Bella I had to remind myself that the boy wasn't related to her at all. By evening, Freddy sounded worn out.

"I need you to play by yourself now while I make an important phone call."

The boy entered the bedroom, breathing loudly. Seeing the disorder on the floor, he picked me up and turned me around, close to his chubby face. He touched my beard. Then, clutching me like a trophy, he carried me across the hall into a room with a bunk bed, upper and lower bunks unmade, stuffed animals lolling on the blankets. When the boy turned, a doll house careened into view and grew larger as he lunged toward it, thrusting me into a room next to a mouse in a frilly blue dress and white apron. Noah knelt, staring in. Then he got up and retreated to the bottom bunk, scrunching back into the disordered blankets. Hunched over, he started thumbing something close to his face.

"They were such a happy family," the Mouse said. "Noah will be lost without his sister."

"Not technically his sister," I felt compelled to point out.

The two of us stood in a neat, three-walled bedroom with a brass bed, a rocking chair (though neither of us hinged in the middle) and a round carpet, all vaguely Victorian.

"What upset Bella?" I asked. However, if anything the Mouse knew less than I.

"They had a fight. People do, sometimes. Maybe Freddy broke something. That's usually why Nora and Noah fight. Nora broke Noah's Lego helicopter after he spent so long putting it together."

"I think this was a bit more complicated, psychologically speaking," I said.

"Anyway, Noah forgave Nora. Maybe Bella will forgive Freddy. You're not in scale," the Mouse went on. "Everything here is one inch to the foot. Still, it's nice having company. Only wish it was under happier circumstances."

At seven inches I was, indeed, large for the doll house. I liked it, though, and the children's bedroom, too. I would have enjoyed watching them play together there.

"I was a birthday present when Nora turned four."

"What's Nora like may I ask?"

"She wears skirts and plays with dolls but she also loves softball. Noah's not athletic. He loves Harry Potter and Legos."

Freddy leaned into the room from the hall. "Thanks for playing so nicely while I was on the phone."

Noah, thumbs hammering away, mouth slightly open, said nothing and Freddy backed away. Later, she returned and came into the room.

"You can't do Gameboy all evening."

"Mommy reads to us."

"Okay, choose a book."

Freddy sank her substantial jeans-encased bottom into the blankets and opened the book he gave her, reading about the adventures of one Encyclopedia Brown.

"What else?" she asked, Frisbeeing the book onto a pillow.

Noah slipped off the bed and came to squat in front of the doll house.

"I've never played with dolls," Freddy said. "I'm not sure I know how."

"I found a man." He pointed at me, then at the mouse. "They're married."

"A man can't marry a mouse."

Noah stood. "No."

He returned to the bed and curled up again with his electronic plaything.

"I'm kidding. Come on, show me how to play."

"Not without Nora."

Freddy sighed and continued to sit there, staring out, while the boy played.

"What if Bella and Freddy never make up?" the Mouse asked me. "He needs his sister. She needs him."

"She's not his sister."

"Those children belong together."

"Noah and Nora have about as much power over their destinies as you or I."

A week or perhaps ten days later, Freddy came in, beaming, "Guess who's here for a play date?"

Noah's comic book fluttered to the floor as he crawled out of the lower bunk. Nora walked in past Freddy, a good six inches taller than Noah, in a short pink dress, striped leggings and dirty white sneakers.

Freddy lingered in the doorway. "Did Mommy say anything when she dropped you off? Like, about me? Think she misses me?"

"I don't know."

"Bet she misses her garden," Freddy said, heartily.

After Freddy withdrew, Nora said, "It looks the same," picking up a stuffed tiger on the bed and throwing it down again. She eyed the half-made Lego helicopter on the floor, then approached the doll house.

"I found the old man," Noah told her.

"He's too big for the mouse."

"They're married. Okay?"

"Okay. And they adopt Harry Potter."

She galloped to the Legos box and back with a tiny, oddly square plastic boy, setting him on the round carpet between the Mouse and myself.

"You like living with Gramma?"

"No. Mommy and Gramma yell a lot. You like living alone with Momo?"

"No. She sits in the dark and drinks beer."

Nora dropped down on the floor, crossing her pink-and-purple striped legs. "We need to fix this helicopter."

Noah knelt beside her. "I know."

For a moment, we three — tall old man, tiny boy, and mouse — were quiet in our miniature bedroom, then the Mouse said, "He's not in scale. Much too small. Still, I've always longed for a son."

"I think I have, too," I said.

"Bollocks," said the little plastic boy. "Yer not me mum. And yer not me dad, either."

The children lay on the floor on their elbows, Noah pawing through gray cubes, black bars and flat red squares, while Nora studied the instructions.

"We need two gray cubes with four bumps each."

An hour or so later, Freddy's shadow fell over the children, the light in the hall behind her.

"It's good to see you guys playing together. I missed that." The children looked up at her from the floor. "If Mommy could see you guys…" 

"Mommy could see you guys…"

She came in and sat heavily on the bottom bunk. Her eyes looked blurred. Perhaps she was tired, working too hard.

"So, Nora, I'm out of the loop here. Maybe you can help. I hear Mommy has a new friend. That true?"

"Mommy has lots of friends."

"Right. So, does this friend sleep over?"

"No."

"Really? Cuz this guy at work said—"

"—Mommy goes to her house."

"And leaves you?"

"With Gramma. Mommy and Gramma need time apart, Mommy says."

"Fuck."

Noah laughed, looking at the Lego pieces in his hand.

Freddy stood and came toward the doll house, kneeling with a grunt.

"Here's a nice little family scene. Only three, though. Is this guy an only child?"

She picked up Harry, talking in a high voice, "Where's my sister? I want my sister. Did the dragons take her?"

In a deeper voice, Freddy said, "We don't know, son."

Then, in her real voice, Freddy said, "Christ, my hand looks old."

Dropping Harry onto his side, she got up, hand braced on thigh. With a wave to the children, she walked out of the room.

"Momo's weird." Noah, crossed-legged on the floor, spun the plastic helicopter propeller with his index finger.

"Next time you come to Gramma's."

"I heard that." Freddy lurched round in the hall. "What's so bad about being weird? And what's that crap about 'next time Gramma's?'"

She stood with her arms apart, hands gripping the door frame, leaning into the room. "Mommy and Nora belong here. I'm going to make sure they come home soon. Know what? Mommy once said that when I want to do something I go out and do it."

She backed away. Moments later, loud music began thumping in the living room.

"That bitch left me on my side," Harry Potter said, lying on the little round carpet at my feet.

"Why don't you try magic?" said the Mouse.

"Abracadabra. Hocus pocus. Alakazam." He was silent. "If yer me mum and dad, why can't one of you set me straight?"

"Be patient, son, one of the children will set you straight soon enough."

"Because yer not me mum and dad, that's why. We're not a family."

"Of course we are. Don't upset your mother."

My definition of family has become more flexible. Now that I've seen Noah and Nora together I know that they are family, too.

Later, the music switched off mid thump. At the sound of the front door opening, the children both stood.

"Come on, pumpkin." A bulky leather bag hung from Bella's shoulder. A large pair of sunglasses sat atop her thick black hair. "Let's make like a banana."

"No rush," said Freddy. "You guys can go get a Popsicle out of the freezer first."

The children ran away, all legs and stocking feet.

"When you see the two of them together…" Freddy stared at Bella, while Bella studied the Legos on the floor.

"I know. I promise I'll never keep them apart."

"You made a promise to me once before, when we stood on that cliff near Carmel. I thought it was forever."

"We had a good thing."

"Until, what, kids messed it up? Are you serious? These kids are forever, like it or not. They're real. They bind us together, Bella."

"You're so controlling."

"Controlling?" Freddy clamped a hand on Bella's face, thumb and fingers sinking into Bella's soft cheeks, wrenching Bella's face toward hers. "My fate is in your hands. I don't even know what's going on outside of this house. I hear rumors."

The children returned, sucking on purple Popsicles. Bella ducked out of Freddy's grip. Pressing on Nora's back, she guided the little girl out of the room.

Noah followed, leaving Freddy alone.

"Shit!" Freddy's hiking boot kicked the pile of Legos, sending gray squares, white bars and red rectangles skittering across the floor. The helicopter careened onto its side, losing its propeller and part of one wall.

"Oooo, humans behaving badly," Harry said.

"Such a shame," the Mouse said.

This is what I think: I think Freddy will keep on loving Bella and do what she can to get Bella back. The rest is up to Bella. If I were Isis, I'd pray for them. As an inactive Action Figure, I can only watch and hope. Surely, a family cannot come apart as easily as a Lego helicopter. Or perhaps it can. What do I know of human behavior? I'm not a real psychiatrist. My plastic head is hollow. I'd like to make Bella return. I imagine leaping out of this doll house, ballooning to a full seven feet. But what can I do? What can any of us do?

So I say again to my new son, cursing at my feet, "Patience, Harry, patience."
