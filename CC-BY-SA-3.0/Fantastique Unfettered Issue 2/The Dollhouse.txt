Aldus carried rooms inside himself, a dollhouse of seven floors guarded by his ribcage. The walls were built between his lungs, behind his heart and among his other organs with the smokestack coming up to sit at the base of his neck, giving off fine smoke rings that puffed out of his nose from time to time. A neighborhood of people lived there: tailors, doctors, teachers and bakers, making homes of the rooms Aldus kept. He was not quite sure how they had gotten there, unable to clearly remember a time before or after them. Aldus believed they had appeared there the morning he awoke to find splinters in his bed, tiny finishing nails between his teeth. In the bathroom he stood before the mirror and traced a fresh raised line from his neck to his navel, as though his ribs had been pushed open, stretched out and pulled shut again, but bulging beneath the skin. Like Aldus's recollections, in time that too faded.

For many months Aldus woke as the occupants of the dollhouse slept and whenever he slept they woke, rising from their beds to begin their days. Booted feet stomped up and down staircases, babies cried and doors slammed, rattling mirrors on walls. Little voices traveled up Aldus's spine to color his dreams with their troubles and conversations, filling his head with the trivial strife of lives Aldus could not reach. At night he scratched across the thin topography of his chest, playing at his ribs like piano keys to deter them, but without avail.

"Stop it," he would groan into his pillow, tossing restlessly back and forth across his bed. "Stop it, stop it, I have to sleep. I have to work in the morning, don't you understand?"

The tiny occupants did not listen, or if they had they did not care. Each night Aldus could only half-sleep, waking to the sounds of couples fighting and children fussing and old men wringing their leathery hands. Each day he went to work at the office and felt tired, rubbing the sleep from his eyes and yawning wide into phones and during meetings. In the evenings he went home to eat dinner and crawl in bed knowing he would not rest, and soon began to dread it. Inside of him, the occupants went about their noisy lives unaffected by these difficulties, too consumed by their own to pay Aldus any mind.

After so long without reprieve, Aldus would wake in a daze to the final sounds of shuffling feet and rustling blankets as the neighborhood slipped at last into sleep. He began letting his fingers run determinedly under the row of buttons of his pajama top, imagining stitches there. A bisecting zipper where his ribs met that he could undo and open up, looking inside his chest at the dollhouse, to squeeze, perhaps shake the people inside for keeping him up at night. It was then that Aldus knew the dollhouse was driving him mad, the occupants sighing and moaning in his sleep about the dreary minutiae of cheating spouses, sick children and mortgages past due. He knew he must do something, or risk letting his sanity steal away in an unending parade of boot-heels and voices.

At his wit's end, one morning Aldus took a knife from the kitchen drawer, prepared to silence the people inside him. In the bathroom mirror he traced the raised line from his collarbone to his belly with the blade, splitting himself down the middle. He took the walls made of his ribs in hand and worked them gently apart until the bones and plaster gave way. They were divided by a seam and hinges and he pulled the dollhouse open wide, searching the floors and rooms where its tenants slept. There were nearly one hundred of them now, generations of parents and children, grandmothers, grandfathers and old floppy dogs. They were tucked away safely in their beds all but for one. A little boy of five, or maybe six, sat at his bedside in tired pajamas, his sheets and blankets looking equally worn-through, his eyes and hands clasped tight in prayer.

"Dear Lord," the boy murmured, his clumsy whispers made louder by the silence, "please bless us, my Mother and Father and Robert and me. Please fix the leaks in our roof so that our beds stay dry, so that Robert won't be so sick all the time and Father doesn't stay up late worrying and Mother doesn't cry. Lord, please bless us and keep us safe."

Hearing this, Aldus's anger dissolved. Even for his strife he could not harm a child so small, especially one as quiet and reverent, and dressed so plainly in second-hand clothes. He abandoned the knife on the bathroom counter and took up the cotton balls from the cabinet instead, using them to plug the holes in the child's roof and packing them in tight.

As the boy crawled into his bed to sleep Aldus closed his chest again, sewing it up with needle and thread. That night after dinner he lay down to sleep and heard boots stomping and doors slamming, old dogs barking the same as before. Through the din, rather than sighs and complaints he found tiny voices hushed in prayer instead, asking the Lord for patience and gentleness. Babies still cried and mirrors still rattled on the walls, but plugging his ears with the cotton from the cabinet, Aldus slept nonetheless.
