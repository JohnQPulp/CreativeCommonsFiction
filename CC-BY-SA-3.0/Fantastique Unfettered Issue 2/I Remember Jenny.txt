I remember Jenny. Her fine, blonde hair trimmed like a pixie. Or was her hair long and black, thick lustrous waves? She was tiny, small-boned with fine features. Or was she tall, high cheekbones and coltish legs? It doesn't matter. The details are blurry.

But I remember Jenny.

—

She was nine when it happened, I think, and I was seven. It was a sticky southern New England summer, the heat and humidity setting everyone on edge, ready to snap. And that summer some folks did snap, in the form of two rival biker gangs, the Lords and the Earls, inexplicably attracted to our little city, claiming it as their own. The gangs went to war that summer, although I was only vaguely aware of it. Until the awful incident in the park.

My parents discussed it in bits and pieces of whispered conversation. Someone was dead. Crucified in the park, my father said, and I wondered if it was Jesus. But even then it was no more than a blip on my personal radar screen. It would have remained that way, if not for Jenny.

"They burned his eyes out with battery acid," she said one day, referring to the murdered biker. Her blue-brown-green eyes flared with excitement. I was the only boy in the neighborhood, my playmates all girls. My best friend, Lisa Cartin, an older girl who treated me with gentle patience, was at her grandmother's house, and so Jenny and I were playing with Jenny's toy horses, her obsession, Citation and Man o'War and Secretariat.

"My mom said he was nailed to a tree with railroad spikes," Jenny said. She capered a horse across the cracked sidewalk, while I knelt, watching, trying to imagine the murdered biker.

"We should go see where it happened," Jenny said. The idea hung there like a heavy, overripe fruit. I didn't answer. "We should go see it," she said again.

"My mother would kill me," I said.

Jenny smiled. "Okay." But it wasn't over. We played with the horses a while longer, re-enacting races, the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness. She stopped again and looked at me.

"Want to go to their house?" she asked.

"Who's house?" I asked.

"The Lords' house. It's close by, my brother says. We could peek in. It'll be an adventure." I wanted to say no, but Jenny was so pretty. As I started to shake my head, her mouth pursed into a little "o" of disappointment, and I relented.

"Sure," I said, and we went.

We rode our bikes, my white Huffy racing alongside Jenny's purple Barbie bike, sparkly tassels streaming from her handlebars. Or was it a pink bike with a red banana seat? It doesn't matter.

I remember Jenny.

We left our housing complex, riding onto Elbert Avenue, a main road, forbidden to me by my parents. It was magical, exciting, transgressive. It was dangerous, too, and I knew it. I just didn't know how dangerous.

I didn't think we'd find it, but we did. At least, we found a house. It could have been the Lords' gang house. It was a huge old Victorian, built when New Wales was still a thriving city, its forefathers still proud of what they had created. The Victorian had seen better times, the smudged white paint faded and peeling like leprosy, the windows dusty and dirty. No one seemed to live there.

"This is it, this is the place," Jenny said, her skin smooth and pale. Or perhaps dark and exotic.

"How do you know?" I asked. My hands kneaded the grooved, plastic grips on the end of my handlebars.

"I just do." Her words were convincing. She was like a dousing rod, attuned to adventure. Or magic. She walked her bike down the sidewalk to the front door. I wanted to run home, but didn't.

Dusk was settling and I wondered how long we had been gone. It was dinnertime and my mother would be worried. But my concerns were overwhelmed by Jenny, by the vividness of her reality. When she beckoned me to follow, I did.

I left my bike on the sidewalk and ran to her. She smiled and then she too dropped her bike to the ground. We walked to a big bay window set to the right of the doorway, trampling through the shrubbery growing along the front of the house, wild and untended.

Did anyone see us that day? Did anyone look out their window and see two kids, on their tippy-toes, peering into the grimy windows? Did they see Jenny, her face pressed against the glass, straining to look into what we thought was a dangerous world? Did they consider intruding upon our little fantasy and stopping us?

If they did, they didn't act upon it. Instead our fantasy intruded upon us.

"Do you see them?" Jenny asked. I was a good four inches shorter than her, and was having trouble seeing anything. But I wanted to please her and those big blue-green-brown eyes and so I nodded.

"Yes," I said, although all I could see was dirt and filth and multiple shades of brown.

"I can't believe it," she said. "They're wonderful. So beautiful." What was she talking about? I stepped on a small white boulder protruding from the ground, but my battered Converse All-Stars slipped, unable to purchase a grip. I grasped the window sill to steady myself. Jenny turned.

"They want us to come in," she said.

"Who?"

"The people inside. The cool people." Cool people. Like movie stars. Or gods. But I didn't get it.

"Who, the Lords?" I asked. "We can't go in there. They might crucify us or something. We should go home."

She looked at me with a look I would later realize was sympathy. "Not the Lords," she said in a quiet voice. She backed away from the window and started toward the front door. I stared at the back of her pink t-shirt (or was it blue?). She turned.

"Are you coming?" she asked, and my heart said yes. But my head said no.

She stepped up to the old, wooden door, and held her hand out in a fist, knocking once. I should have done something, screamed for help like my mother told me to do if approached by a stranger, but I didn't. It didn't seem right.

Did the door open? Was there a figure in the darkened entryway, cloaked in a white robe? Did it hold out a hand, and did Jenny take it, looking at me one last time, beckoning with her sad eyes, then entering the house, leaving me alone? I don't know. I remember it happening. But memories are ephemeral things.

I biked home. My tires whirred over the sidewalk, cutting through the haziness of the dusk and the buzzing of the electric lines overhead. Fear, palpable, like snot coating my throat, threatened to choke me.

Jenny had been kidnapped. I remembered something she had said to me one time about kidnappers, while we played with her horses. "They put Popsicle sticks in your privates," she said. That thought saturated my mind as I pedaled, convinced it was true. I biked faster.

Nothing looked familiar. I was lost, and thought I would never find my way home. But then the sound of my mother's voice, high-pitched and on the verge of panic, reached my ears, and I headed toward her. When I pedaled out of the darkness into her vision, her knees seemed to buckle in relief.

"Where in God's name were you?" she asked, even as she swept me off my bike, letting it clatter to the ground. "I can't believe you would take off like that. Your father is out driving around looking for you…" She looked into my eyes.

"Are you okay? Did something happen?" She shook me with a ferocity that snapped me out of my haze.

"Jenny's been kidnapped," I said, and I could tell she didn't believe me. Then I told her the details, told her about looking for the Lords' hideout, about the house, about how Jenny went in.

"Let's get home, now," she said in a hard voice. We headed off, my mom running alongside my bike. She made two calls as soon as we arrived.

One to Jenny's mother. The other to the police.

—

They never found her. Jenny's snatching was a huge story, gracing the front cover of the New Wales Journal-Enquirer for weeks. And I was the co-star in that drama, the survivor. The lucky one.

I tried to help the police, but it was hopeless. A police officer drove me in his cruiser, looking for the neighborhood where Jenny had disappeared. When I told him we had been at the Lords' hideout, the policeman, Officer Tartleton, looked at me with a gentle smile and said, "There is no Lords' hideout, son. At least none I'm aware of. You'll have to show me where you were."

So we set off, but I couldn't remember where the house was, my memory addled by fright and confusion. I've never been good with directions. We drove up side streets and main roads, past older homes and newer subdivisions, until finally I thought we had found it.

"Right there," I said, pointing to a Victorian made visible in the gloom by its lone porch light. We approached the home together (to this day I'm amazed Officer Tartleton didn't make me stay in the cruiser), and as we moved closer I realized something was wrong. This home wasn't abandoned. It had freshly painted dark green shutters and clean windows. I could see a television through one, the Red Sox playing in Fenway Park. Officer Tartleton rang the doorbell.

"Can I help you?" said the man who answered, and he didn't look like a kidnapper at all. He was tall and thin, wearing a blue t-shirt that said "Salty Dog Café" and gray athletic shorts. He was barefoot, and looked surprised.

"Yes, sir, I'm sorry to bother you," began Officer Tartleton, and I could tell he didn't think this was the right house. It was. And yet it seemed nothing like the house we had found. Peering behind the man, I could see pictures on the wall, a sofa, a coffee table with a tin of Jiffy Pop on it. Could I have been wrong?

Then I saw her, in the archway between the living room and the kitchen. She had red hair and too-big green eyes, as if her pupils were straining to absorb all the available light. A swath of scarlet freckles danced across her otherwise pallid skin. She looked nothing like Jenny. But it was her.

"There she is," I said and Officer Tartleton looked down at me. He had already put away his notebook and was making small talk about the Red Sox.

"Who?" he asked.

"Jenny." I pointed into the home, past the man at the door, who looked at me with a smile that made my skin itch.

"I'm sorry, son," the man said, "but you're mistaken. That's my daughter, Karen. Come here hon."

The girl approached. She wore a green t-shirt and jean shorts, and I thought I might be mistaken. Then I saw the toy horse, a broad Chestnut, Secretariat, clutched in her small hands, and knew I was right.

I remember Jenny.

"That's not your daughter," I said, "that's Jenny." Officer Tartleton put his hand on my shoulder.

"Calm down," he said, "I know this has been upsetting, but no use worrying others." He knelt down to the girl's height. "What's your name?" he asked.

"Karen," she said, her voice clean in the still, muggy air. In my head, she said Jenny.

"I'm sorry, sir," said Officer Tartleton to the man, and then we left, his hand firm on my back. I felt chastened, embarrassed. But it was her.

They never rescued Jenny, never returned to that house to retrieve her. I went to therapy for awhile and was declared cured. My parents wanted it that way, wanted to forget all about it. Jenny's family moved away within the year and everyone wanted to close the chapter. But I couldn't.

I saw Jenny two years later at Disney. The Florida one. Part of my therapy, the sunlight and happiness designed to erase the past. Scrubbing me like steel wool, leaving no trace of what happened. Instead, there she was.

She was with an older couple, the man graying, wearing a "World's Best Grandpa" t-shirt, plaid shorts, sandals. The woman wore a formless pink summer dress, her hair blonde, a bad dye job. They were happy, Jenny waving to Goofy, eating pink cotton candy. I stared at her, her long blonde hair, her twinkling blue eyes. Her pale blue t-shirt was decorated with a horse decal, a rearing stallion, fierce and proud. She walked past, our eyes meeting for one moment, recognition flickering and then snapping closed.

I remember Jenny.

I didn't see her again for six years or so, until tenth grade, a field trip to New York City. A Broadway musical, Brigadoon, or maybe Cats. Chinatown for dinner. My friend Mark Tardy had brought some booze, little nip bottles of Schnapps and brandy swiped from his father's bar. We drank in the back of the bus, crouched low behind the high-backed seats so our teacher, old Mrs. Galloway, wouldn't see us.

The liquor burned my stomach, the acidic taste stewing in my innards. Sick, both Mark and I struggled through the musical with cold sweats, suddenly not so cool, not so smart. But by the time we arrived at the Chinese restaurant, I was feeling a bit better. A little hungry even, despite the fact the authentic Chinese food looked nothing like the takeout back home in Connecticut.

I saw her at the restaurant, even as I stared at my soup, avoiding the little floating things that looked like eyeballs. She was Chinese, her hair long and thick and black, straight down her back. She was with a teenage boy, her boyfriend, in a table in the back corner. I thought nothing of her at first, sipping my soup, willing myself to swallow it. Then she raised her napkin to her mouth, exposing a charm necklace against her blue turtleneck. A horse charm.

It was her, Jenny, Chinese features or not. I stared at her, my soup forgotten, until she looked back. She smiled at me, and I was sure. It was the same smile, the same mischievous, happy, carefree smile. Jenny's smile. I ate nothing further, watching her, studying her until she left, gripping her boyfriend's hand. She had black nail polish on her fingertips, a silver ring on her thumb. They walked by us and she looked at me one final time.

She winked. I remember that wink, remember what it stood for, what it invited. Freedom and adventure. Then she was gone, leaving me with my sour stomach and a plate of cold food.

I remember Jenny.

She was at my senior prom. Debbie Torgleson was my date, a junior who I wasn't really dating but who had made out with me at some parties, hiding behind the haze of a six-pack of Bartles & Jaymes wine coolers. We had a fight and she stormed off to the ladies' room, her bright green prom dress trailing behind her. I could have chased her, but didn't think I needed to. It was my prom, after all, and Debbie wasn't going to ruin it. I was heading back to our table when I saw her.

Jenny, in a light blue, low-cut gown, walking toward me. It was her, even though her hair was curly and dark. When she bumped into me, I grabbed her, my arms around her waist, feeling her so close, so real, so alive. She stiffened, as if my touch offended her. Was it her? But then she leaned over, her mouth at my ear, and she whispered.

"Citation," she said, her voice barely audible in the blare of the music. Our code word. A shiver of excitement trickled down my spine, like the last drop of champagne being drained from a glass. That one word, so normal, so sensual, so personal. She backed away, her face once more a mask of anonymity. But I knew.

I remember Jenny.

I only saw her once that night, but it was enough. Later, I imagined her as Debbie and I had sex in a bedroom in Mark Tardy's parents' beach house, and I almost cried out her name when I came.

"I love you," Debbie said afterward, misunderstanding my passion, thinking it was for her.

"You're great," I responded, and Debbie's eyes dimmed. She dressed while I lay there, thinking of Jenny, and left without a word. It was a relief.

I danced with Jenny in college one night, at Charlie O's, a local bar. I was drunk, so smashed even my friends had abandoned me, and it would have only been a matter of time before a bouncer threw me out. One was approaching me as I swayed unsteadily, my face hot, my stomach sloshing. She cut in between us.

"He's with me, I'll take care of him," she said to the bouncer, a thick block of a man. He looked at her and I didn't think he would buy it, but he did, turning and hunting for easier prey.

"Thanks," I said, aware, even through my drunken haze, of the embarrassment from which she had rescued me. "Do I know you?" I asked, and she smiled. She was a redhead again, her hair up in a loose bun. Not a freckle-faced redhead, but a mature, sensual one. Auburn. Her eyes were green and they sparkled, as always.

"Dance with me," she said, and she took my hand and led me out to the dance floor. We danced, her body fluid, so natural even I could follow. I realized what other, better dancers must feel, the melding of two bodies into one. Like sex, just like people say.

We danced and the night passed, and then it was last call, the lights flashing, and I imagined her leaving with me, making love to me, letting me in on the secret. Instead, as the last song played, she pushed me against the wall and kissed me, hard, urgent, her tongue probing my mouth, and then she pulled back just as forcefully. She smiled a sad smile and left. Only when the door had closed did I feel the small business card she had pushed into my hand.

It was her. On the front of the card was a drawing of a horse and the name, address and phone number of a local head shop, "The White Pony." On the back was her handwriting. "Call me," it said, but there was no number. I suppose she could have meant to call her at the White Pony, but I didn't. I've never been comfortable in places like that. Too wild.

I kept the card, pulling it out occasionally to look at it, to smell it, imagining I could smell her, inhale her essence. Over time, the handwriting faded, leaving a blank where her presence had been. But the memories don't fade.

I remember Jenny.

I hadn't seen her since, until this week. I was sure she would be in attendance at my wedding, smiling at me even as Laura and I exchanged vows. I couldn't have gone through with it if Jenny had been there. She wasn't at the birth of my daughters either. She left me alone, let me live my life. But I didn't forget.

She's moved next door. I watched her out my window, watched the moving van pull up, watched them unload her stuff. Weird stuff, hanging beads and psychedelic art and crap like that. I felt funny as I watched, my skin prickly, and then they unloaded the statue, a black stallion carved from what looked like obsidian, dark and muscular and alive. I knew it was her before I saw her.

She's come full circle, blonde and petite, the way I think I remember her. Ethereal. I watched her direct the movers, alone, unmarried as I knew she would be. Keeping the faith. She saw me standing in my picture window and she waved, a shy wave that belied the invitation on her face. I waved back, a raise of my hand, and then I went into the den and retrieved the business card from my desk drawer.

"Are you okay?" Laura asked when she found me, and I nodded yes. It wasn't a lie. I'm better than I've been in ages.

Laura and the girls are at the movies. I'll be gone before they return. It's been a long time, but in some ways it's like it was yesterday. I'm going over to Jenny's house, and when she answers the door I'm going to tell her I'm ready, I want to join her and the cool people, and then I'm going in.

I remember Jenny. And I won't let her forget me.
