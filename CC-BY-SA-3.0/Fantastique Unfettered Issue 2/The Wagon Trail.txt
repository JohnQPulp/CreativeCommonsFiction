When the wind had put away its knives and the sky cleared to a black that promised frost, Marcus rose from his post by the Union bank, filled a grey holdall with cardboard bedding, and approached the softly glowing brazier beside the wagon.

"Could I share your fire?" he called from a distance.

"It gives out heat in all directions," its owner replied, lifting his toes to warm the base of his socks. "I see no harm you taking some."

As Marcus approached, the man flapped away a sleeve and shook his hand. He was shorter than he had looked in the day, and his coat flapped as the wind gusted. A loosened tie curled over his high stomach. Beside him stood a pyramid of thirty or forty china cups, glistening in the firelight.

"Horace Runcible," he said.

"I saw you on the wagon, selling drink," Marcus said.

Runcible nodded. "Try some."

He passed over a terracotta jar with a faded label that read, "whiskey," and Marcus took a sip, paused, took another, then passed it back with a frown.

"Tastes like water."

"Some say that. Some do say that."

As Runcible spoke, Marcus noticed the man's eyes travelling up his body and he became conscious of his broken shoes, ill-fitting jacket, and, suddenly, how much his beard itched.

After a moment, Runcible slid nearer — three o'clock to Marcus's six — and asked, "how long have you been homeless, son?"

"Four months."

"And how is life?"

"Cold, mostly."

"Have you ever had a job?"

"Yes sir. I've laid sleepers on the railway, and I was once apprenticed to a newspaper."

"So you understand the power of advertising?"

"I guess."

"Take a look at the wagon and tell me what you think of her."

Marcus didn't like to leave the fire, but some resonance in the man's voice made him walk over. When he got there, he rubbed his hand along the wagon's timbers and found them as smooth and hard as pebbles from a stream.

"It's old, isn't it?" he said.

"Been in the family for years," Runcible said, his voice loud above the cracking twigs and ruffling canvas.

Marcus knelt closer. The base planks seemed shapeless in the dark. He made out engravings, smoothed with age, which might have been runes or religious symbols.

Canvas flapped above Marcus' head, and he looked up to see the words, "H. Runcible: Elixir of life."

"Do you like it?" Runcible asked, though from his tone, Marcus wondered if he meant the wagon or something deeper.

"Yeah," he said. "I think I do."

He stumbled back, surprised to find his hands still warm, as if the wood had been heated from within.

Runcible took a long drink, then smiled. "There's a job here, son, if you want it."

"Doing what?"

"Selling water to those who need it, of course."

—

The next morning, Runcible hitched up two sad-looking horses and they set off.

After a slow beginning, the Kansas countryside began to reveal itself. Traffic whizzed past, but Marcus felt relaxed thanks to a large cooked breakfast. He was also warm for the first time in months.

"Why don't you use a truck?" he asked, as one rumbled past.

"People expect a wagon," Runcible said. "They want the old ways." Then, as the morning turned to afternoon, he added, "Why were you homeless, son?"

"Things didn't work out, I guess."

"You lost your job?"

"Yes sir."

Runcible let the horse plod on for what must have been ten minutes, before asking, "Was it a woman?"

"My wife—" Marcus let the sentence drift off, realising he had no idea how to finish.

"Do you still miss her?"

Marcus laughed. "No." But after a moment, he added, "She took my daughter, Catherine."

"Have this," Runcible said, passing over a jar of elixir.

Ralant took a long drink and looked away.

Soon the wagon began to roll through a thickening row of houses. Runcible parked opposite a row of shops, beside a patch of waste ground.

"Now you'll see the reason for a wagon," he said, tying back the canvas panels.

He leaned out, and held up a bottle, shouting, "people of Kansas, come closer, come closer. This is the elixir of life here. Yes, the elixir of life. Not a drug or a scam — this is the greatest thing in existence. The actual holy grail in a bottle, better than whiskey and better than beer. Today, you and your family can experience an explosion of satisfaction. Your happiness guaranteed, ladies and gentlemen, or your money back."

To Marcus's amazement, people began to gather, beginning with a couple of pensioners who must have walked over out of nostalgia, but Runcible dealt with each customer in turn, splashing transparent liquid into the mugs Marcus had seen drying the evening before.

Comments spread through the growing crowd. Some twisted their mouth as if the drink tasted bitter, while others took on a faraway look, but most of them asked for more.

"How much?" a short woman asked. She wore a bright red headscarf around greying black hair and clutched a bulging shopping bag.

"One dollar a bottle," Runcible said. "Always has been, always will be."

The woman passed over her money, and Runcible took an empty bottle from the back and filled it from a metal tap that emerged from a dark blue tarpaulin.

Later, when the crowd had departed, they sat watching silvery curtains of rain pour off the canvas, until Marcus said.

"Where does the elixir come from?"

Runcible walked into the back and hauled off the tarpaulin, raising a cloud of dust.

"Rain enters here," he said, pointing to a metal funnel attached to the canvas roof. The funnel led to a dark wood box. "And it's processed here and here." Runcible indicated further boxes in a sequence, all connected by metal tubes. The third was lowest, and held the tap.

"But what's inside the boxes?" Marcus asked.

"Sometimes it's best not to know," Runcible said, and he immediately drew the tarpaulin back, and was unwilling to talk about it further.

Town after town fell like leaves from a tree that had clung on through the winter. In one, Marcus intercepted dregs from a thin bespectacled man who had scrunched up his face as if the drink had been bitter. He sipped it carefully.

"It still tastes like water," he said.

"Some do say that," Runcible said, over his shoulder, as he passed out more to an eager crowd.

Marcus began to help, and served a couple of customers, though he noticed Runcible always handled the money, stuffing dollar after dollar into a dark green satchel on his waist.

Marcus tried calculating the takings. That day alone must have been several hundred dollars, and the next town was no different. Each night Runcible cooked simple food, bought bottles from recycling centres and slept on the floor by the wagon.

In the evening, Marcus watched as Runcible packed the takings bag carefully below his pillow before settling, and imagined how full it had to be. Just three hundred dollars, he thought, might be enough to take him across the state line to see his daughter.

The next town was older, built around a main street with long-established trees. The people wore less clothes here, and they smiled more, though as Marcus calculated their best takings yet, he noticed a boy cross the street with a couple of bottles and share them with three others. The children had ill-fitting clothes, and a thin dog lay beside them, its pale fur even paler along its gaunt stomach.

"Do you ever wonder," Marcus asked that night, "whether we're doing the right thing?"

"We're offering a public service," Runcible said, turning twice to swaddle himself in the dark green blanket he always used.

"Are we?" Marcus said, with such force that Runcible opened his dark eyes and sat up on his elbows.

"What's the problem, son?"

"Just that we're selling rubbish, and then leaving before people find out."

Runcible pointed to the fire, where a small pile of aluminium pots stood stacked after Marcus had washed them. "You weren't complaining when it bought you supper," he said. "Anyway, what do you really mean?"

His eyes seemed to pierce Marcus, and for a moment he felt ashamed, but then he felt the heat of the fire on his cheek, urging him on.

"Just that if we are fleecing suckers, I'd like more out of it." The moment the words were out of his mouth, he felt ashamed, but had no way to take them back.

"Is that so?"

"I mean I'm grateful for you picking me up, but don't you think I deserve a chance to save, and maybe visit my daughter?"

Runcible sat up fully, and for a second Marcus watched his face cross the line of shadow. His nose seemed abnormally long in the darkness.

"You believe we're conning people," he said, his voice more resonant than ever, "and because of that you'd like more money?"

"Well, I—"

"You want to be a more successful thief, is that it?"

Runcible was louder now, and Marcus found it impossible to look away, but neither could he find words to explain his feelings.

"I have an idea," Runcible said eventually. "We'll be in a new town tomorrow. Why don't you watch me do all the jobs?"

Marcus felt his breath stop and the night seemed to be at his back close in. He was suddenly conscious of being in a small globe of warmth that did not beat away the cold at all.

"You want to demonstrate you can do without me," he said, and even to him his voice sounded desperate.

"Not exactly," Runcible said. "I want you to learn."

—

The next morning, as they dropped down to the town, the only sound a jingle of harness and the slow whoosh of a car, Runcible said, "tell me about your daughter."

"She's thin, with brown hair," Marcus said.

"What does she want to do with her life."

"I don't know."

"Does she have any hobbies?"

"Drawing maybe."

"What's her favourite flower?"

"Jesus, Runcible, she's just a little girl."

"Did you never try talking to her?"

For a moment Marcus had a lump in his throat, and Runcible must have noticed, because he passed over some elixir as easily as he offered it to a customer.

Marcus stared at the grey horizon first.

"Maybe not enough," he said eventually, "but it wasn't right to take her away, either." He drank then, without looking over at Runcible, and when he finished he realised that the water had tasted sweeter than usual. It seemed more filling, too, as if he were a dried-up sponge struggling to regain its shape.

That morning, Marcus watched as Runcible said to one woman, "Just think, madam, with this drink, dresses as beautiful as the one you wear now will be bought for you always," then to a man whose body sagged inside his beige tee shirt and slacks, he knelt and whispered, "this, sir, is health for the body as well as the mind."

Runcible did not move, Marcus realised: he pranced and sprang, twisted and gestured, so that even the black-tee-shirted youths, who Marcus would have thought too proud, had to smile. And wherever Runcible went, people bought and bought.

Halfway through, as Marcus had learned to time the ebb and flow of crowds, Runcible stepped back and asked, "were you watching me, or them?"

"You, I guess,"

"Then watch them instead. This is your chance."

He strode forward again, and this time Marcus followed a young man in a faded suit worn to a shine over his right shoulder. The man hovered on the edge of the crowd, leaving Marcus unsure whether he was wary of buying or nervous of people, but when, suddenly, the queue thinned, the man advanced and spoke with a shaking high voice.

"May I have some."

Runcible knelt, and said, "not from me," so loudly that Marcus stared in astonishment, but before he could turn away, Runcible placed a hand on his shoulder and said, "but please allow my assistant to help you."

The man stepped to the side, but as Marcus filled a bottle with the translucent liquid, he still could not understand why anyone should buy it.

He sealed it with a cork and passed it over, then, because he did not want to take advantage of the man, he also poured him a small cupful.

"Try this first," he said.

The man coughed so deeply, that after a dozen seconds, Marcus wondered if it might turn him inside out, but he slowly regained his poise and took the water as if it was precious. He drained it, and for the first time, smiled.

"Yes," he said. "That's how I remember it."

He bought two more bottles, and as he walked away, Marcus watched him swing them against his leg, as if listening to music.

Am I the only one who can't taste it? Marcus wondered.

That night, he waited till Runcible finished spooning sausages from the casserole — and then said, "I watched that man seem to change after tasting the elixir. Is that what you wanted me to see?"

"Maybe."

"What's in it?"

"What do you think?"

Marcus took a sip from the cup he had poured himself, wondering if repeated attempts were making him more sensitive or more gullible. It still tasted of water, although soft, too, as if the rain had dripped every piece of hardness out. If you added soap, the lather would never stop, Marcus thought.

"Oak casks make wine taste different," he said after running it over his tongue for a long time. "Is that what people taste?"

Runcible smiled. "Ever heard of the placebo effect, son?"

"Where a drug works because everyone believes in it."

Runcible nodded, then leaned back against the wagon and closed his eyes till he appeared to be asleep. "Sometimes it's best not to know," he said at last.

Marcus found the evening quiet after that. Runcible seemed disinclined to talk, so he watched the fire dance through the holes in the brazier, and felt its warmth sink sweetly into his bones. He yawned and stretched, feeling at peace, though he knew he'd have to move on sooner rather than later. Ever since he'd joined, he'd felt his daughter growing ever more distant, and this was no way of earning the money to see her on equal terms.

Just as he was wrapping himself in his blanket, Runcible whispered, "I've been waiting for you to taste it, but I think you're near enough."

"For what?"

Runcible stretched out under his own blanket, staring upwards. Marcus followed his gaze, then smiled at the high white clouds and the crescent moon.

"I've not been a good man," Runcible said.

"I don't—"

"—because I've been weak. My problem was whiskey."

"But you only ever drink elixir?"

Runcible whispered something that sounded like "hmh," then added, "what do you call a man who drinks only water, son?"

"A teetotaller?"

"An alcoholic."

"I don't think any of us are without sin, sir."

Runcible did not reply, and Marcus watched the clouds slide past and wondered how he would fare on the day of judgement. 'Your crime is indifference and anger,' he imagined the heavenly lord saying.

By the time he thought of another reply, Runcible was snoring, so he let himself drift into sleep too.

When he woke, he was alone — and when he pulled on his clothes and walked round the wagon, he found nothing but two horses cropping the grass, and a small letter upon the riding seat.

Dear Marcus,

I suppose it's time when it feels time. Here's a secret no-one knows: I've been an actor, a singer and a politician, but selling this elixir has felt like the only honest thing I've done.

I inherited the wagon from a pair of fellows in Missouri, who got it from a woman further south, and she got it from someone before that. If you look at the construction you'll see it's older than any of us, and now it's yours.

There are only two things you don't know that you ought — one is the best route, which I've drawn on the back of this letter like they did for me, and the other's that you should never look into the boxes. Sometimes it's best not to know, son.

Other than that, just learn to love her like I did, keep the horses fed, and in any case I'm not giving you much choice because I'm keeping the money. I wanted capital to retire with, and when I took you on I already had enough. I've known for many a town that it was time to move on.

Look me up if you're in Bellingham sometime,

Your friend,

Horace Runcible

P.S. What with the name already painted on the side, it'd be good business sense for you to begin calling yourself that. It worked better for me than my own, Russell Philip Stanmore.

Marcus walked into town and checked the railway and greyhound stations, but Runcible had gone.

When he returned to the wagon he found Runcible's cup and sleeping blanket neatly stacked inside with the dark green money pouch, though, as promised, the pouch was empty.

The next two towns were lonely. Marcus took over three hundred dollars in the first and four hundred in the second, but he kept missing Runcible. Rather than squandering money on hotel rooms, he kept to the life he had been shown, making a fire each night and sleeping by the wagon, though each morning he woke early and stared across the cold brazier as if the old man might be still lying there.

Part-way through the third day, Marcus went in search of a bank.

"Can I help you sir," said the teller with a smile, that made Marcus feel uncomfortable even though he knew he was clean from a standing wash. Nonetheless, he placed the dark green bag onto the counter, smiled, and said, "I'd like to open a deposit account with six hundred dollars."

It was the same situation in town after town. He bathed in rivers when he could and banked money without checking the balance. When the rain grew scarce, he filled the funnel with tap-water, and still couldn't notice a difference.

He got into a rhythm and managed for a time to forget Runcible, and even Catherine. Occasionally, he pulled back the tarpaulin and stared at the dark wood boxes, but he always obeyed Runcible's advice and left them alone.

—

One night, six months later, Marcus was passing a pawn shop when something caught his eye. It was a tiny ring for a child's fingers, and he almost wept as he imagined how much larger Catherine now had to be.

He returned to the bank and asked how much was in his account. The answer elated and terrified him in equal measure.

When Marcus returned that evening, he brushed down the horses and stared at the city lights on the horizon.

"This is better than being homeless," he said to no-one in particular, adding, "I need a bit more to be certain."

That night, he thought he imagined Runcible's voice on the wind, calling him a coward.

The next town was prosperous, as was the one after that. And though a few customers complained that the elixir was just water, there were no more than usual. Yet he had a feeling, as the days grew cooler, and the rain glazed the slowly plodding horses, that he was a slow fuse heading for a moment of explosion.

One night, he brought the wagon away and caught a glimpse of men standing beside a tree. Although there was a streetlight opposite, they had chosen to stand in the shadows.

As he drew closer they approached, and Marcus saw that their clothes weren't good and one's trainers had a split down the side. He stared at their faces and wondered what to say, because they seemed so very young.

He nodded to the first boy, who had to be in his early twenties.

"Can I help?"

"We want your money," the boy said, his hand shaking as he took out a knife.

Marcus glanced at the other, who was walking to the far side of the wagon. His first thought was, that they were stealing from his daughter's future, and he began to grow angry — the kind of anger that had stormed him out of the house when he had been married.

As they approached, Marcus grabbed a long metal soup ladle. For some reason, the boys became entwined with Catherine in his mind. He imagined her lying on the pavement somewhere, attacked by thugs like these and his anger grew still more. He had worked too hard, he thought, to be robbed.

As the first boy put his hand onto the side of the wagon, Marcus swung the ladle and felt it connect. The boy vanished onto the wet road, and without waiting, Marcus swung the ladle at the second boy and hit him in the face.

He leapt from the wagon, but the fight had gone. One boy had blood across his nose and the other held his arm as if it was broken.

Marcus advanced and they backed off, then collapsed as their backs touched the wagon, sliding down to the floor. The boy holding his arm whispered, "please, mister, don't hurt us."

Marcus felt his anger collapse, too.

"You're just kids," he said. "How old are you?"

"Twenty-three, mister, and my brother's twenty-two."

Marcus's ladle slipped lower until it came to rest against his thigh. He looked at the plastic bags lining their shoes, and remembered how he had felt once.

"You're homeless," he said. It wasn't a question.

"We got a home if we want."

"But you don't, do you?"

The boy looked away. "We need to get out of town."

As Marcus knelt, the boy flinched. "Was it your daddy beat you?" he asked.

"Yes sir."

Despite his temper, that was the one thing he had never done to Catherine. Marcus felt furious again, though this time cold and determined and focused on the boy's father.

He reached out and took the boy's arm, feeling along it. "I don't think it's broken," he said at last.

"I'm sorry," the boy said.

Marcus nodded, noticing how both boys gripped the base timbers, as if the ancient wood gave them comfort, and he wondered just how long the wagon had been plying its lonely trade and how many drivers it had helped. Above the boys, behind the driver's seat and past the rows of stacked up bottles were a set of wooden boxes he had never looked into, and now he realised he never would.

He smiled, realising he had kept the trust Runcible had implied, but never fully explained. If he had looked, he wondered whether he might have seen something to prevent him from honestly passing the wagon on. In the distance, he thought he felt Runcible smiling.

Marcus stepped back and looked down at the boys, though his mind was filled with his daughter and what it might be like to see her once more.

"The name's Horace Runcible," he said, "and I offer you food and a ride to the next town if you'll have it. Work, too, if you want."

When he held out his hand, the boy with the bust nose sniffed once and blinked, then took it.
