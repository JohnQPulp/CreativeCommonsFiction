The red truck was there again, I noticed.

My wife and I — both of us sixty, retired, and with time to kill — had seen it a half-dozen times or more over the past couple weeks: a late-model, red, Dodge Ram 1500 Crew Cab pickup truck, perched idling at the exit gate of a nearby subdivision and possibly watching over the construction underway across the street like a brooding sentinel.

This clear spring morning, as Carol and I drove north on Houston Levee Road in Shelby County, TN, my curiosity got the better of me. As we neared the Ram, I flipped my left turn indicator on, swung across the street, and pulled up alongside the truck. I pushed the power window button, waited for my window to descend, then, smiling, motioned to the driver to roll down his window as well. He simply ignored me and nothing happened.

I waited a moment, listening to his engine rumble like a hungry beast, and tried to see through the truck's darkly-tinted windows. A vague feeling of unease swept over me then, raising the fine hairs at the back of my neck.

"Hon," Carol said, lightly touching my thigh, "why don't we leave now?"

"Yeah, okay." I patted her hand, still distracted by the unknown male driver. And that's all I was able to determine due to the truck's unusually dark camouflage: that there was a man behind the wheel, not a woman. And while I stared at the truck, I glimpsed a strange symbol on its front quarter panel. It appeared to be about a foot-high caricature or cartoon drawing of some sort, depicting a darkly-garbed man with a black hat and black mask covering his eyes, holding something in his hands. I couldn't make out anything further about the design, however, as I quietly backed our Honda CR-V out of the driveway, and once again entered traffic heading north.

"Jay, what was that all about?" Carol asked after we had put some distance between us and the strange vehicle.

"You got me. I was just trying to be friendly. You know — tease the driver about what he was doing there. Geez!"

"How do you know it was a 'he'?"

I stole a peek at my wife before returning my attention to the road. "Well, about all I could see was the outline of a guy." I glanced at her again. "Beyond that I couldn't say."

"Why'd he ignore us?"

"Beats me," I said.

I checked the rear-view mirror this time for any sign of the truck following us, but came up empty. I let out a small sigh of relief. Why am I being so paranoid? I wondered. The guy just didn't feel like chatting…

Brushing aside these troubling thoughts, I glanced again at Carol and said, "Did you see the design he had on his truck?"

"No, what design?"

"Ahh…it was nothing. I'm not even sure what I saw."

Out of the corner of my eye I saw Carol look at me quizzically. I'm not sure why I decided not to tell her what I'd glimpsed, only that for some reason the drawing had struck me as a little peculiar. But, once again, I swept the feeling of unease from my mind as easily as brushing crumbs off the dinner table.

We went about our business the rest of the day, and on our return home that afternoon, I was secretly happy to see that, as we passed by its regular spot, the red truck was gone.

—

The next few days passed without any truck sighting, and the inner turmoil that I had felt during and following my lone confrontation with the faceless driver waned until it seemed like nothing more than a distant memory.

—

Until the afternoon I spotted a red truck in line about four or five cars behind us as Carol and I drove to the grocery store.

"Shit."

"What's wrong?" Carol said.

"I think the red truck might be following us."

"What?!" she squealed, twisting around in her seat to look out the back window.

"I can't tell for sure," I said, still peeking at the rear-view mirror, "but there's a red truck behind us, a few cars back, and it might be a Dodge Ram."

"You think it's the same truck?"

"I don't know. Let's see if it follows us into the store's parking lot."

I hung a left at the next stoplight and made my way down to the Kroger Store, pulling into the huge parking lot. After swinging into a stall a bit removed from the cluster of cars already parked nearby, I turned my attention back to the red truck, which was waiting on traffic in the left-turn lane at the stoplight. It finally made the turn, chasing another car through the yellow light, and cruised down the street I had just traveled, continuing on past the grocery store.

Unconsciously, I let out a sigh of relief. I dropped the can of pepper spray I had latched onto into the small compartment between our front seats. My hands felt hot and sweaty.

"Whew," Carol said. "Do you think it was—?"

"I don't know," I snapped. "It wasn't tailing us, it probably wasn't even the same truck."

"Okay…" she said, put off by my tone.

"Come on," I said a little softer, killing the engine. "Let's get our shopping done."

I slid out of the SUV and Carol did likewise.

—

I spotted a red truck several times over the next few weeks while driving around, with and without my wife. I had no idea if it was our truck, but the frequency of its appearance behind me in traffic ruled out, in my opinion, any chance of it being totally coincidental. I never mentioned it to Carol, either, for vanity, I guess. Having spent most of my life in the criminal investigative arena, solving cases for the county and later assisting attorneys in similar fashion, I was annoyed to discover that despite my highly decorated past, I was currently at a loss to expose the mystery behind the driver of the red truck. On a couple of occasions I had even tried to double back behind him to ascertain his license plate. But each effort had proven fruitless as the Dodge Ram easily slipped off in another direction, disappearing like a wraith. Even my many law enforcement contacts were of no help; they calmly explained to me that I was probably being a bit paranoid, but even if something indeed was up, without a license plate their hands were tied. They said to be careful. Well, I had said to myself, I thought I was being careful.

—

Then, one night around 10:00 or so, I was in the living room catching the late news when I heard a low rumbling sound coming from the street outside. Carol was surfing the Net on the computer in our bedroom and couldn't hear it. It sounded like a dog growling, but I had a funny feeling it was actually our red truck, the driver nudging the gas pedal to catch our attention.

I pried apart the blinds of our front window and peeked out. Sure enough, the red Dodge Ram was out there, idling at the curb on the far side of our narrow street. I wasn't certain what I should do. Confront him and run the risk of danger? Or simply wait him out and see what happens? But before I could come to a decision, he gunned the engine one last time and pulled away from the curb.

I raced to the front door and threw it open, hoping to catch his tag as he sped away. I was too late. But not too late to pick out on his driver's-side, front quarter panel, as he made a left turn a short distance away, the odd, cartoon-like design I had first glimpsed almost a month ago. It seemed to glow in the dark, like it had a life of its own. Strange, I thought. But it was him, definitely him.

What do you want? I wondered.

A while later, after I had resettled into my La-Z-Boy and Carol had come up for air from her Internet surfing, I told her what happened. She wasn't happy that I hadn't called her.

"I've tried to cash in favors with some of my buddies at the Sheriff's Office, to try and ID this guy, but that hasn't panned out yet. And now this…weirdo…knows where we live!"

"Oh, God, hon!" she said. "Are we in trouble? Is he dangerous?"

"I'm not sure… We do need to be careful from now on," I said, embracing her. "At least until I find some way to put an end to this madness."

"Jay, I'm scared," she said, squeezing me tightly.

"We'll be fine," I said with false bravado. "Just let me handle it."

—

I didn't have any game-changing plan or strategy that I was prepared to implement, and it bothered me. All I was doing now was reacting to the machinations of the red truck's operator instead of doing something proactive. It frustrated the hell out of me. Even more than usual, because this time Carol was involved, too.

I had already called on the resident manager at the small apartment complex where the unknown driver chose to idle his truck, and had also gone across the street to chat with the foreman of the ongoing construction project. Neither person had any information I could use in my efforts to identify our stalker; in fact, the female resident manager and the burly foreman swore they had never even seen the red Dodge Ram in question!?

With such horrendous results under my belt, I was certain I was going to lose my mind before too long. The only saving grace appeared to be the fact that neither Carol nor I had observed our truck for several days, not since the night the faceless driver had surprised me with his unexpected visit. Perhaps he's given up, I thought hopefully. Maybe… But given up what?

All we could do now, I guessed, as PO'd as it made me, was maintain our vigilance: be careful outside around the house, and use special caution when we drove around the city and suburbs while running our usual errands.

—

But Carol and I slowly relaxed our guard after a couple more uneventful days passed by. Until one night she complained that her acid reflux would not go away with her usual medicine.

"Do you need me to get something stronger?" I said.

"Yeah, I guess I could try the Extra-Strength Prevacid."

"Let me run up to Walgreens," I said. "Will you be okay for a few minutes?"

"Yes. Just hurry back."

I gave her a quick kiss, then dashed out to the garage and started up our SUV. It was around 11:30, and I was fairly sure the pharmacy stayed open until midnight. I backed out and closed the garage door before speeding off on my errand of mercy. The prospect of running into our M.I.A. red truck at this late hour was as remote as the possibility of me being struck by lightning during my short trip.

I was barely gone twenty minutes.

But even as I crept down our narrow, dimly-lit street, I knew something was wrong. I could sense it somehow; my thinning head of hair stood up for a second and my back tingled as if I'd been in close proximity to that improbable lightning strike.

Sitting innocently at the curb in front of our house was a red Dodge Ram. Our truck.

"Shit," I whispered in disbelief.

A welter of emotions overwhelmed me: anger, fear, and worry topping the list. Adrenaline flooded my system; the fight or flight syndrome kicked in. Face hot and flushed, I stomped on the gas pedal as my line-of-sight narrowed in tunnel vision. I stood on the brake seconds later, trying not to burn rubber as I skidded to a halt abreast of the truck.

Squinting through the passenger window, I spotted the odd, cartoon-like design on the side panel and attempted to see if our inscrutable driver was behind the wheel. But with the poor street lighting, the late hour, and his heavily-tinted windows, it was difficult to determine. I was fairly certain that he had already exited, though.

I gunned our SUV around the Dodge Ram, catching more of the design's details in my peripheral vision, and swung into our driveway, choosing not to raise the garage door and risk alerting him to my presence. Killing the engine, I slid out of the car and quietly closed the door. I moved cautiously around the garage toward our front entrance before realizing that not only had I failed to get a good look at his license plate in my earlier haste, I had also left the canister of pepper spray in the SUV.

"Shit!" I mumbled for the second time in less than a minute.

With sweat dripping from my forehead, I knew that time was of the essence. I decided to take my chances, and continued on toward the front door, whose familiar, softly-glowing porch light belied the underlying tension I was feeling right now.

I paused momentarily at our solid oak door, unsure of whether I should enter quietly or barge in and make my presence known. This guy had gotten into my head a little more than four weeks ago, and now he had gotten into my house — I decided I'd had quite enough of him. Right or wrong, I twisted the door knob, which was unlocked, and charged in calling out to my wife.

"Carol! Carol, where are you!?"

I moved deliberately through our living room, scanning the area for the intruder and latching onto the fat Maglite I kept by my recliner in case of a power outage.

"Carol!" I shouted again, a second or two before she poked her head out of the kitchen at the rear of our house, a grim look etched upon her face.

"Jay, look out!" she cried.

Her warning pulled me up short but, before I could react, a large figure hiding in the hallway fell upon me, striking me hard on the back of the head with a heavy, blunt object. As I fell to the floor, the flashlight slipping out of my grasp, a subtle smell, not unlike rotten eggs, trickled up my nose. Then I passed out.

"…Jay…Jay…! Wake up, please!"

I slowly came to on the living room floor with Carol hovering over me, her hands alternately caressing and shaking my face.

"Wha — what happened?" I said, trying to sit up as a bout of vertigo washed over me. I gently touched the back of my head, where a golf ball-sized knot trickling blood throbbed in time with my heartbeat. "Geez," I moaned as a sour taste filled my throat. "Are you okay, hon? Is he gone?" I struggled to stand, my eyes searching the room for the truck driver, finding the front door slightly ajar.

"He's gone, Jay, sit back down. I'm fine, too."

I fell more than sat down on our couch, my jumbled mind trying to piece together the puzzle of what had happened.

"What time is it?" I asked, elbows on my knees, hands cradling my head.

"It's a little after midnight. You've been unconscious for a couple minutes. We need to get you to the hospital."

"I'll be okay," I said, the bitter taste in my mouth receding. "How'd he get in?"

"He knocked on the front door right after you left. I thought you'd forgotten something, and opened it without checking. He came right on in and…the next thing I remember, you were barging into the house. Then he hit you with a pipe or tire iron, I guess. Oh, Jay, you might have a concussion. We have to get you to the Emergency Room!"

"No," I said, reaching for the phone. "I need to call the police first, have them come out here and look around, take our statements. Then we'll see…" I rubbed my head again with my free hand, blood streaking my fingers. "Hon, grab a towel for me, please. I'm still bleeding." Then I carefully punched in the number for the Shelby County Sheriff's Office.

Ten minutes later a pair of sheriff's deputies knocked on our front door, followed shortly by Dave, a former co-worker and friend of mine, who made the scene out of personal concern as well as professional courtesy. My buddy was already aware of the ongoing trouble we had been having with the enigmatic truck driver, but Carol and I repeated the events of the past month in chronological order anyway, culminating with the home invasion and assault at our house. Meanwhile, the two deputies scoured the house's interior and the front yard for any pertinent evidence or clues, but found none. And due to the fact that I had again been unable to ID the intruder's license plate and had shortly thereafter been knocked out cold, the only valuable information I provided for Dave and his incident report was the description of the Dodge Ram and its odd, cartoon-like design. Surprisingly, although Carol had supposedly been alert and relatively untouched throughout the ordeal, her memory of the nightmarish ten minutes or so alone with the intruder was sketchy at best. I believed strongly that the stress and trauma of the incident had given her temporary amnesia, and hoped that time would eventually lift the gauzy veil that now enshrouded a portion of her mind like a dense fog.

As soon as Dave and the deputies departed, Carol convinced me to let her drive us to the hospital: obviously, I might have suffered a concussion from the blow to the head, not to mention the fact that I probably needed a couple of stitches; in Carol's case, I simply wanted to ensure that she was physically all right, and a thorough examination would help ease my mind, as well as hers.

In due time I received four stitches and a diagnosis of a mild concussion; Carol received a clean bill of health, physically anyway; and we both received an ironic shock on discovering our late-night incident's catalyst which I'd forgotten on the floor of our SUV's front passenger seat — the pharmacy package containing Carol's medicine.

Three hours later we were back home.

—

We spent the next several days holed up in our house like a couple of hermits. My head still throbbed sporadically and I was prone to bouts of dizziness and nausea, but my health was improving steadily. Carol appeared to be none the worse for wear, although at times she exhibited sudden, unlikely episodes of moodiness and silence; but I was more concerned about her bruised mental state and how the ordeal would affect her in the long run. She still had not come to terms with the events of that night or her selective amnesia, the answer to either of which would shed light on what actually happened to her and what the intruder wanted. I was fairly certain that sexual assault had not occurred, but then it begged the question: what did happen?

A week after the incident we began venturing outside, taking short trips in our SUV with Carol behind the wheel. And each time we passed the spot where our red truck used to sit, we exhaled a collective sigh of relief at its extended absence. Sure, we wanted the driver to be caught and brought to justice, but at the same time, we were just as pleased inside to discover that he had most likely gone into hiding as a result of what he'd done to us. Dave had come by a few days earlier to check on us and advise that no leads had surfaced in the investigation. So, I had already begun to believe that the case would likely end up as a dead file.

Another day or two passed before I noticed that, even as my condition improved, Carol's worsened. She was losing a lot of sleep and appeared fatigued all the time now; she was also losing weight and the pounds sliding off her left her already thin face and frame even more lined and slack than ever; and her periods of moodiness and quiet had become more frequent. I suggested a visit to her physician and she agreed. But after a battery of tests, her doctor found nothing physically wrong with her, suggesting only that she increase her intake of "B" vitamins, eat regularly, rest often and try to get more sleep, which he hoped to solve by slipping her a prescription for mild sleeping pills.

"How're you feeling?" I asked her from the shotgun seat on the drive home.

"All right, I guess… I just feel so tired and sluggish lately."

I paid special attention to her response, stared at her once-beautiful face, which now seemed almost as rough and dried out as a lifelong sun-worshiper. She looked to me like she was shriveling up right before my eyes. What the hell is wrong with you, Carol?

"Do you remember anything more about that night, hon, anything at all?"

She glanced at me quickly, tearing her eyes from the road for just a second. "I've been thinking about it a lot lately…" she replied. "And one thing I do recall is him…putting his hand on top of my head…and placing his other hand…in the center of my chest…" She paused, her face frowning in concentration. She started to cry then, softly.

"What's wrong, baby? What did he do?" I thought my worst fears had been realized.

"No, Jay, it isn't what you're thinking." She sniffled, peeked at me again. "He mumbled something I couldn't make out, like he was praying or chanting. Then, after several seconds, he pulled his hands off me and backed away. That's…that's all he did."

"It's a start," I said, stroking her upper leg, my mind swirling with ideas.

"But the weird thing," she continued, "is that when he removed his hands, it felt like he took something from me. That something was missing after that. I can't explain it…"

"All right, hon," I said, shaking my head over the possible ramifications of her story. "Let's not worry about it right now. Just get us home. We'll talk about it later."

We talked about it later, and often over the next few days. I had no answers for her, but I had a couple of theories — none of them good. I couldn't quite wrap my head around the seemingly innocuous actions of our intruder; but the more I thought about it, the more I realized that he had done something to Carol that night, something bad. And when her physical condition deteriorated drastically soon thereafter, and a return trip to her doctor offered no explanation, I knew one thing, and one thing only — Carol's life depended entirely on me finding our mysterious truck driver and coercing him to remove whatever pox or plague he had loosed upon her during his late-night visit.

—

A week has passed and the two of us, in our SUV, now cruise the surrounding streets from sunup to well past sunset, searching for the elusive red truck. I drive now, since Carol's motor functions have become impaired and she has extreme difficulty simply walking. Always a thin woman, she's now down to eighty-five pounds and her emaciated body looks like the desiccated husk of a butterfly cocoon. She can barely talk. Sometimes what she says makes no sense at all. She's dying. And I think I finally know why.

You see, the driver of the red truck didn't infect Carol by giving her something — he caused her to slowly shrivel and deteriorate by taking away something. Her essence, her vitality, her soul, if you will. Carol, herself, had stated that she felt like something was missing after he'd touched her that night. I finally pieced it all together when I remembered the details of the perplexing cartoon design on the truck fender. The night the proverbial "shit hit the fan," I got a good look at the drawing. It was definitely a darkly-garbed and caped man, wearing a dark brimmed hat with a black mask covering his eyes. But what I also saw was the large, stuffed brown bag he clasped in his hands, like a bandit. It seemed to be glowing, as if with life. The caricature-design was that of a thief, a robber, a stealer of souls.

I recalled as well the mild odor of rotten eggs I smelled as I fell to the living room floor the night he struck me. The scent of rotten eggs — sulfur — in legends has always been an indicator of the presence of Satan or his minions. As preposterous as it sounds, I now believe that our truck driver is an otherworldly emissary whose mission is to lure unsuspecting people into his trap and steal the essence of their lives, their souls. And the reason why no one else seems to remember the red truck sitting innocently at its post just off a main street, alert for victims? Apparently it's only visible to those he believes are sensitive or susceptible to him and his nefarious agenda.

Again, I may be completely off base with this, but I doubt it. In any case, it would be understatement to say that "time is of the essence." But it is. Because not only is my once-beautiful, loving Carol wasting away before my very eyes, but this morning, when I gazed into the bathroom mirror while shaving, I noticed the sudden onset of old age lines creasing my features and a conspicuous sagginess to my cheeks that hadn't been there the day before. I feel so tired now. I think after the truck driver slammed me to the floor he took something from me as well. Something that Carol didn't remember seeing him do, but which I also need to stay alive.

Despite the fact that the sun set hours ago, I continue to drive the dark streets with Carol beside me, hoping to locate the stealer of souls. I will continue as long as I am able.

God help me.
