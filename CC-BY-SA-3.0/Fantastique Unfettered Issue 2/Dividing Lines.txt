"So, you're really going through with it, then?" My words sounded hollow. I already knew it was a lost cause, but I felt obligated to put up at least a token resistance. Our relationship must have been worth that much.

"David, we've already been through this a hundred times," sighed Sheila. "And we both agreed it was for the best. There's no going back."

I didn't bother to reply. She was right of course. Eventually you have to hold your hands up and admit defeat. Our relationship was over. We'd tried patching it up so many times before, but this time the life had finally gone out of it. There simply wasn't any point in going through the charade again. We'd only end up back at this point. Better to get it over with here and now.

"My car's outside," Sheila continued. "The sooner I get my stuff and go, the better."

I tried adopting a conciliatory tone. "How is your new flat anyway?"

"Fine, David. Just fine. It just feels a little bare at the moment. A little impersonal, you know?"

"Sure," I replied. "Mind you, at least now you'll be away from all my junk."

I smiled to show that I was only joking, but we both knew the truth. I was a reader, a collector, a typical male hoarder. I just don't like throwing things out, especially books. So what if I'd probably never read them again? They were my possessions and I liked having them around. Just knowing they were there was comforting.

Unfortunately Sheila was the opposite. She liked open, airy spaces. A few well-placed ornaments and family photographs, but absolutely no clutter. She said she felt hemmed in by all my books, as if they were looming over her all the time. Go figure.

Anyway, it wasn't the deal breaker, it wasn't the deciding factor in why we split up. It was nothing we couldn't have worked around, if we'd wanted to. It was just one of two dozen little things that all added up to two people who simply shouldn't live together.

I watched Sheila as she moved about the house, placing her few remaining possessions into a large black bin liner. I realised this would probably be the last time for her between these four walls and tried to fix the image of her in my mind. Some people believe that buildings can absorb the essences of those who have lived within them. I wondered if I would be haunted by the ghost of Sheila in the weeks and months to come, if I would feel a phantasmal echo of her presence, only to look up and find her gone. Haunted by the ghost of someone who hadn't even died. That about summed me up.

"I think that's it," she said eventually, dragging the by now bulging black sack back to the front door.

"Here — let me." I hoisted the bag aloft, my last chivalrous act for my one-time girlfriend, and carried it outside. The back seat of her car was already crammed tight with cardboard boxes. I could remember moving those same boxes into our house a year before and the giddy sense of excitement I had felt at the time. The future had seemed so full of promise back then, but it had all come to nothing. I turned away before I could let it affect me further. I had to be practical right now. I had to see this thing through. Time enough for emotions later.

"Well — that's that." Sheila hesitantly walked towards me and we shared an awkward final embrace. Eventually she broke away and turned back towards her car. She opened the driver's side door but before she could get in she let out a strangled yelp and stood up hurriedly. She had seen something ambling down the pavement towards her. Something, or rather someone that she knew.

"Chester!" she cried. "Oh my God, I nearly forgot the cat! What was I thinking of?"

Sheila slammed the car door shut and raced to meet Chester. The cat let out a chirruping meow of greeting and arched his back up towards the expected stroke. As Sheila knelt down to pet him he rubbed himself against her legs, purring like a well-oiled engine.

I was shocked. "Chester? You can't take Chester. He's my cat!"

"I think you'll find he belongs to me, actually," Sheila replied. "You do remember giving him to me as a Christmas present, don't you?"

"Well — yes. But still. He's my cat. And besides, you won't have room for him in your flat, surely?"

"Oh come off it, David. You know as well as I do that Chester spends every possible moment outside. He only comes in for food and sleep."

That much was true. Chester was a pedigree cat, a brown spotted Bengal. As a kitten, we had at first intended to restrict his movements to the house, but he had terrorized us so thoroughly that eventually we gave in and started letting him out. As soon as we did so he became an entirely new character. No longer did he wake us up in the middle of the night, howling like a deranged hyena. No longer did he launch unprovoked attacks on both us and the furniture with seemingly unretractable claws. Instead he expended his energy outside and showed his appreciation by transforming into a loving and lovable pet.

"Well I can't give him up!" I cried. "I simply refuse to do it."

Sheila paused in her stroking. Chester was now lying on his back, his orange and brown spotted belly exposed for the world to see. Sheila slowly ran one fingernail from his neck down to his lower abdomen. Chester mewled in delight. "Well, I suppose there is one other option," she said.

"Oh — and what's that?"

"We could always share him."

Three months later I found myself sitting in my back garden and feeling positive for a change. Sheila had arrived on one of her weekly visits and sat beside me, basking in the summer heat. It was my day off, the sun was out and I had a cold beer in my hand. All of a sudden life seemed bearable. I realised I was grinning and found it difficult to stop.

"Look at him. He's loving it, isn't he?" Sheila pointed towards Chester, who was racing about the garden as though possessed. He suddenly arced his back and flipped himself into the air, his mouth snapping shut on an innocent cabbage moth that had made the mistake of fluttering nearby. Poor bastard.

"Yeah, he certainly loves his playing," I agreed. "It's nice to see him running about like this. I don't suppose he's able to do much of that at yours?"

Sheila looked pensive. "Well, it's true he hasn't really gone out much. Not yet, anyway. I think he's still getting used to the situation. He'll be fine though. He's a real lap cat now."

I just bet he is, I thought. Still, there was no denying it was nice to see Chester having so much fun. Luckily - or unluckily depending on how you looked at it — Sheila and I had never got around to having a family of our own. So in many ways Chester was like the son we never had. It was understandable that neither of us wanted to be parted from him.

"Anyway," Sheila continued. "Lovely as all this is, I'm afraid I really do have to be going soon. Marcus is meeting me for lunch."

"Oh, really?" I tried to stay in a positive frame of mind and not to think about her new boyfriend. I shouldn't begrudge her moving on. And who knew — perhaps one day soon I'd find someone new myself?

"Yes. Sorry, I did promise him. Come on. Let's get it over with. Chester!" The cat looked up as Sheila called his name. She clicked her fingers and whistled at him. Chester approached at a hesitant lope, his shoulders slumped, as if well aware that play time was over.

Sheila scooped up the cat in her arms and cooed at it like a baby. "It's alright, kitty kitty. It's OK." She raised an eyebrow at me. "Come on, David, hurry up. Let's not make this difficult on him."

I sighed and stepped closer until Chester was cradled between us. I scratched him gently behind the ears. "Come on, big fella. You've done this before. You know it doesn't hurt."

I nodded at Sheila. It was time. We positioned ourselves around Chester, her holding his right-hand side, me holding his left. Keeping a firm hold, we began to draw apart.

In truth pulling Chester apart took no more effort than peeling open a banana. The cat split cleanly down the middle, a dividing line opening up from the top of his nose down to the tip of his tail. There was absolutely no blood, no spillage. There never was. As we pulled apart I could see Chester's internal organs exposed to view like an illustrated anatomical cross section. There was his severed heart, still beating rapidly like some fragile, tremulous bird. Upon each side of the widening divide a lung continued to inflate and deflate, their synchronicitous movements turning ragged and mismatched as the cat's two halves slowly gained independence.

In short, it looked as though Chester had run face first through a band-saw.

I turned my half of the bisected cat around to face his opposite half. The mismatched mirror images stared curiously at each other for a moment, before touching half-noses in a hesitant greeting. Before they could start grooming each other I placed my half of Chester upon the ground. He rubbed himself weakly against my legs, both marking me and using me as a ready-made crutch to lean against.

"I'll see you next week then, hopefully," said Sheila, placing her own half of cat into a large carpet bag. The bifurcated animal mewled softly in the darkness, the outline of its body visible as it gently pushed against the material that enclosed it. My half of Chester waddled forwards as best he could and sat down before the bag. I tried not to look as he awkwardly reached up with his sole front leg and tentatively pawed at the outline of his hidden half. "If not it will be the week after. Marcus has some time off next week and we might want to go somewhere."

All of a sudden I felt a wave of bitterness sweep over me. The positive feelings I had been basking in earlier had vanished without a trace. It was as though the dividing of Chester had reopened the jagged wounds in our own relationship.

"Fine," I said sarcastically. "Turn up when you feel like it. I'm sure Chester won't mind. You've got your own life to lead after all. You've made that perfectly clear."

Sheila scowled. "Don't you dare try and use Chester as a weapon against me. We both know your own happiness is the only thing you care about. I'm leaving now. You can just stay here and stew in your own misery."

And with that, she was gone.

When people enter into a relationship, they have this notion about two becoming one. It's a romantic thought, noble even — but its bullshit, really. People are individuals. Always have been, always will be. The best you can hope for is someone who'll put up with your idiosyncrasies, somebody who'll let you be what you want to be — at least enough of the time for you to survive. Compromise is the key.

But some people still believe that everybody's perfect partner is out there, somewhere. Someone who will complement your life and personality to the fullest degree. Your opposite half — just waiting to be pressed tight against you until you both become part of a greater whole. Well — perhaps they're right, but it's a big world out there, and I haven't found my other half yet.

Once Sheila had gone I picked up Chester's body and led him back to the garden. I guided him through the air as though he was some kind of furry Spitfire. He bared his teeth at the hovering moths but his heart just wasn't in it. It wasn't fun anymore.

When it began to get dark I carried Chester inside and leant him up against the mantelpiece. He doesn't normally mind. Usually he'll just stand there looking like a stuffed animal — or at least one half of a stuffed animal — with only the watchful motion of his single green eye reminding me that he's actually alive.

But tonight he seemed restless, as though eager for something more. Chester stretched his limbs, and made as if to move across the mantelpiece, across the tacky carriage clock and the framed photograph of Sheila and myself. Back when we were two. Back when we were both joined at the hip.

But he's not ready yet. Chester slipped and nearly fell, but I rushed across the room and held him steady. His balance is all wrong. He still isn't used to the single life.

Maybe one day Chester will learn to stand on his own two feet. Or maybe one day he'll be reunited with his other half, and I with mine.

We live in hope.
