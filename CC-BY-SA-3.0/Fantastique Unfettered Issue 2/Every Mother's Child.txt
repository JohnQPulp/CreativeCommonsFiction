The little girl, Relikin, slept close by me that night, huddled almost in my arms. It didn't do any good; I heard nothing, but by morning she was gone.

I felt like hell, of course, but I wouldn't let myself show it. In the Pit, the ones who seemed to really care went to pieces and then they got taken. That was my theory, at any rate. Joslin told me it seemed to her that the ones who made theories went pretty quickly, too, but she was taken long before me, so screw what she said.

Whatever the reason they took Relikin, I didn't have to dwell on it long, because then I saw something else had changed — someone new had been brought in overnight. A man. The capture had gone hard on him, but I could see he was strong, and probably a warrior, going by the empty scabbard at his belt.

I went to him, picking my way over the prone bodies of the Pit's other prisoners who were still sleeping or had nothing better to do than pretend to sleep. He looked up at my approach, blinking swollen eyelids.

I crouched beside him. "Hey. How're you?"

"Not at my best." He licked his lips, swallowed, then spat blood near my feet. "What the hell were those things?"

I shrugged. "Down here, we call them Pit-keepers."

He looked around, taking in the prone, raggedly-dressed bodies, the stone walls, the pale bluish light from some indistinct source high above. It faded sometimes, in what we called night; that was when people were taken, when the Pit-keepers fed. "I guess this is the Pit?"

"Oh, yeah. Say, my name's Pavadan." Only after I offered my hand did I realize how incongruous the gesture was, but he accepted it.

"Rathin." He smiled. Despite the bruises, he wasn't bad-looking. And this close, I could see rolls of muscle through the tears in his shirt. A good choice — I took credit for it, even though it was the Pit-keepers who had chosen, capturing him. I just had the good luck to live long enough to meet him.

"You're a swordsman, aren't you, Rathin?"

"Yeah. How could you—" He looked down and saw his empty scabbard, then his eyes went to my own. "Oh. I see."

"I've been here about three months, near as I can tell. I was part of the hired guard escorting a caravan over the plains. The 'van was attacked — everyone taken. I'm the only one left."

"The only one left?"

"All the others," I said, "are gone. In the night. Nobody ever sees what happens, but down here people… vanish and don't come back."

He pushed himself up, and his bright eyes darted over the Pit. "Was anybody else brought in with me?"

"I don't think so."

"I was traveling with a wizard, a friend of mine. A good friend. We got separated, and when I was looking for him I ran into… Well, you know."

I nodded. I didn't know, exactly, none of us did, but we all agreed: whatever it was had sharp teeth and many claws.

"You don't think…" A frown started, more in the wrinkles of his forehead than around his mouth.

And here was the one man I hoped wouldn't go emotional on me. "Look — whenever they get somebody, they put them down here. If your wizard isn't here — especially after only one night — he's safe."

Rathin relaxed. "Well, that's something."

It was. Perhaps, I realized, someone with strong ties to the outside world, a friend he needed to find, would be even better for my purposes than someone who cared for nothing. "There's something more," I said. "I think I can get us out of here."

That got his attention so fast I expected his eyes to pop from their sockets. "Really? How?"

"I, ah…" I scratched behind one ear, breaking our gaze. "Haven't quite figured that out yet. But, hey, two heads put together are bound to come up with something, aren't we?"

"Right." He said it with such lack of conviction it would have been better if he'd kept his mouth shut.

I added, "Well, it beats curling up in this hole and dying, right?"

"You bet." With a lot more confidence.

Grinning, I got to my feet and offered him a hand up. "Great. Here, let me show you around."

—

There's one thing about the Pit that's worse than the filth and the ugliness and the constant terror: the boredom. Doesn't help, of course, that boredom gives the terror good soil to put down roots, but to be honest, we could be awaiting our turns in the Palaces of Heaven and it still wouldn't be much better. Sometimes I felt so bored it hurt to think.

Showing Rathin around gave me something to do, but it didn't relieve the monotony as much as I'd hoped, since I was, after all, showing him around the same boring Pit I'd memorized weeks ago. It was a vast well, four hundred steps across, the Astet Above knew how deep. The floor was gray stone worn smooth by pacing feet, the walls were rough-hewn gray stone, but not rough enough to climb up. Lying on the floor and sitting against the walls were hundreds of rag-clad, filthy, miserable, and bored men, women, and some children.

The tour's highlight was introducing Rathin to the white fungus that made up our diet.

"Tastes like pork," I said, passing some to him.

He chewed, swallowed. I saw him restraining a gag. At last, in an affronted tone, he said, "Do you think we'll get very far in our partnership if we lie to one another?"

"I forgot to specify rotten pork. Sorry."

I heard once that human flesh tastes like pork, and because of that I sometimes suspected… well, the obvious. I didn't share that with Rathin. After I ate my fill of the rotten-flesh fungus, we rinsed our mouths out at the Pit's single spring. The water was metallic, almost sweet but not as thirst-quenching as it should be.

"And that," I said, drying my hands on tattered trouser legs, "completes our tour of the Pit."

"Lovely place," Rathin said. "When can we leave?"

"Soon as we figure out how."

He craned his head back, looking up at the walls. "Has anybody tried climbing—?"

"Yeah. It usually ends with a splat." I slapped my hand against my damp pant leg. The resulting sound illustrated far too clearly.

Rathin winced. "Right." Then, after a moment's further thinking, "Maybe Anweth can help."

"Your wizard friend? Does he know we're down here?"

"I suppose not. We got separated after an encounter with some bandits on the plains. And when I went looking for him… Well, it's unlikely he'll show up here. Unless he got captured, too."

"Not really something to hope for."

"I suppose not," he said again. He rested his chin on his knees, and his eyes took on a brightness I didn't like. "Too bad, though. Anweth could—"

"Watch it," I said.

"What?"

"Don't… get emotional about things. No matter how much you like your friend, don't smile when you think of him. And don't laugh no matter how funny something is. Never cry." Crying was no worse than the others, really, but it got on my nerves a lot more.

Rathin gave me an odd look, but after that there were no smiles, laughter, tears or distant looks from him. We discussed the possibility of overcoming the Pit-keepers with brute force, but it was an unlikely plan — they could easily match weakened, unarmed prisoners strength for strength. And then we were out of ideas. We fell silent, trying to think of more, but thinking, like most things in the Pit, soon lapsed into boredom, and I at least was done for the day.

—

That night, after a supper of fungus and a lot of water, Rathin and I lay down beside each other. There was some gossiping in the Pit, and I was sure somebody would think we were lovers, but good-looking as Rathin was, I felt filthy to the core, my clothes were so stiff with sweat they'd probably hurt to take off, and I was not in the mood at all. Rathin likely felt the same, because I could have been his sister for the way he treated me.

We did talk, though.

He asked me why he shouldn't show emotion in the Pit, and I explained my theory. I'd never shared it with anybody before, except Joslin — but that was back when I was new, and more willing to share things in general. No more. Sharing was too much like showing emotion, and I suspected the Pit-keepers quite literally ate that stuff up.

"So what do you think?" I asked when I had finished.

"If you're right, it's no wonder people don't last long down here. Every mother's child has to show how they feel sometimes — and Astet's Mercy, in a place like this, I imagine you must feel a lot."

Some people, facing death, do get emotional. But not most swordsellers. I was surprised at Rathin.

"Not me." I turned on my side. "But then, I'm no mother's child."

"You're not?" I wasn't certain if he was mocking me, or only asking to make conversation. But I answered.

"My mother… she was a swordseller. Ran off with every caravan that rolled through town, returned home for a fortnight or so to drink away her earnings, then ran away again soon as she could. Dad would've left, I think, if she hadn't stayed home long enough when they first married to whelp a few kids. Me, my sister, and my brothers." I stretched. "She named the oldest Corim — after the first caravan boss who'd hired her. Dad named the rest. I've always suspected that Corim was Corim's father…" I bit my tongue. It was ugly stuff I was saying, probably true but not kind to Corim, who had for a time been my favorite brother — and anyway, I was speaking angrily. "Anyway," I finished, "I might as well not have had a mother. Dad raised us fine, but she… better if she never existed."

"How's that?" I heard the rest of his question — Really? It would be better if she never existed, never birthed you? If you never existed? Luckily, Rathin seemed to sense I wasn't in the mood for conversation, because then he said, "Funny. I never thought of what it must be like to have a swordseller parent. I wondered, sometimes, about having children… probably best I don't."

"Maybe not," I said. "You're more thoughtful than my mother was, for sure. If you found the right girl and settled down with her…"

He made a strangled sound. "That is…"

"Don't mind me," I said. "I get like that sometimes. Supposing things."

"I'm not really the kind to settle down with a girl," he said, and we left it at that.

We slept, all of us in the Pit, and in the morning there were three fewer bodies on the cold stone floor. Rathin and I were still there, and I didn't let anything else matter.

—

It was Rathin's idea to ask the others to join us.

When it came to brains, two dozen were better than two, and when it came to brawn, four dozen arms were loads better than four. It was a sound idea. I couldn't say why I hated it so much.

"I just don't like working with so many people," I tried explaining to Rathin. "Too many different ways to go wrong. Or maybe it's because…"

"Yes?"

"If we get everybody in on this, we'll have to get everybody out."

"Of course."

"That could be pretty difficult."

He looked at me. Just looked. Some looks say everything that needs to be said and more.

We started by working our way around the Pit, stopping by each huddled body and murmuring that we'd like a few words at the spring.

Not all of them came. I hadn't expected them too, knowing how exhaustion and despair set in after you'd been down there a while, how you didn't feel like doing anything and then pretty soon you couldn't. About a dozen did show up, and that was great, through Rathin and I both knew without saying that we'd have to get the others out as well.

"What do you want to talk about?" The speaker was a woman in a sturdy traveling dress and fraying but stubbornly-holding-together braids. No swordswoman, but obviously practical; I liked her on sight.

"Let's talk about busting our way out of here," I said.

A graying-haired wisp of a man chuckled hoarsely. "Every mother's child of us will agree to that."

Rathin glanced at me, and I imagine I looked like I had a mouthful of manure with lemon garnish, because he said, "Even some of us who aren't mothers' children." Some laughed, probably thinking he had made a joke they just didn't get.

I shrugged. "Everyone wants to get out of here, whatever cliché you want to use to express it." The gray-haired man looked a bit miffed at that, but the others were listening eagerly. "Thing is, we don't have many options. There's no way all of us can climb those walls. Our best bet might be facing the Pit-keepers."

Our audience squirmed.

"Unless anyone has a better idea," I added.

If anyone did, she kept it to herself.

"I think," the practically-dressed woman said, "fighting the Pit-keepers would be the most direct way to save ourselves."

"We are unarmed," Rathin said, though not like he was disagreeing. "Fighting back will be dangerous."

"It's more dangerous and less noble to wait down here like bread stacked in a larder," she said.

Everyone, even Rathin, nodded agreement with her.

"Okay," I said, "here's the tricky part." They leaned closer — I was speaking quietly, though Astet only knew if the Pit-keepers listened in on us. If they did, our gathering by the spring already looked suspicious, but I couldn't help that. "I think that, whatever way the Pit-keepers come down to, er, feed, will also be the way for us to get up. But every time a Pit-keeper comes… we're asleep."

"And it's all but impossible to stay awake," a man said. Others nodded. "I've tried, but always…"

"Yeah," I said. "I think we've all tried. But we all do it alone. What if we helped each other? I think we should partner up tonight, and partners should do anything they can to keep each other awake — talking, singing, hitting…" A few chuckles at that.

"And then what?" someone back in the crowd asked. "Do we attack them tonight?"

"Maybe we should wait," the practical woman said. "After all, we don't know much about them. If we observed…" She didn't look happy about it — of course not; the Pit-keepers only came down for one reason, and if we did nothing tonight, someone was going to die. Probably more than one.

But if we attacked too soon, we all would. Every mother's child of us.

"Tonight," Rathin said, "if I give you the signal, we attack. If not… we wait."

"That's a good idea," the woman said. Others agreed. I met Rathin's eyes, and he nodded. He knew what he was doing, taking responsibility for whatever happened that night.

"Thank you," I said.

"What's the signal?" the woman intruded with her practicality.

Rathin pursed his lips, thinking. "Anybody here named Anweth?"

Nobody was.

"So if I call that name, you'll all know that's the signal for attack?"

Everyone nodded.

"Is there anything else that needs to be decided?" I asked, somewhat impatiently. Partly I was nervous that the Pit-keepers might be watching. Partly I was just through with people for the day. And maybe I was ashamed that I hadn't wanted to help save them because it was too difficult.

"One thing worries me." A thin, pale man with a narrow face said. By the tone of his voice I knew there would be trouble.

"Yes?"

"What if the reason we're all asleep when the Pit-keepers come has nothing to do with discipline or our failing at it? What if we're under a spell or something?"

A nervous buzz began among the group.

"Can the Pit-keepers work magic?"

Rathin shrugged. "Who knows?" Watching him, I knew he wished from the depths of his soul that his wizard friend Anweth was here. Though I had never met the man, I was wishing it myself.

"Let's assume they can't," I said. "If tomorrow we realize none of us managed to stay awake… we'll plan something else."

For a moment I thought the sallow young man would say more, but he didn't. His point was well-made, even I had to admit, but I was glad everyone accepted my suggestion, or at least didn't argue with it. For now, we had no better ideas.

—

Rathin and I partnered up that night. At first keeping awake was easy. We did what we had the night before — we talked.

"Why did you become a swordswoman?" he asked.

"Why did you become a swordsman? Why did your wizard friend become a wizard? Why does a tailor become a tailor, or an innkeeper an innkeeper?" Though in retrospect those last were bad suggestions. Skilled trades usually went to the eldest children. "I was the youngest in my family," I said, "as no doubt you were in yours. We pretty much do what we want."

"But why did you want it?" he asked. "I was thinking, I mean, about how your mother…"

"Yeah, that." I rolled to face the sky overhead, if there was indeed a sky up there. "The thing is, she always ran off with a smile on her face. She made it look like fun."

"Is it?"

With a gesture, I encompassed the Pit. "Pretty cruddy right now, actually."

He laughed. "And what about before?"

"It was… satisfying. I don't know how my mother felt, doing her work, but when I bring a caravan home safely, it feels good. Useful. I can't imagine her ever feeling that way — she seemed to love being irresponsible. But out there, driving off an attack, or watching for landslide or flood, protecting… it's not fun, not exactly, but I like it."

"Yes," he said. "Useful. That's it. Anweth once told me if I ever wanted to settle down, he could support us — it's probably true, wizards can be well paid. But I didn't want to settle. Living off somebody else, even somebody I… well, I'd feel useless."

"How do you think Anweth feels, following you everywhere?" I asked. I tried to imagine it myself, and couldn't — I'd never had any friends I cared enough to travel alongside for any length of time.

"He doesn't always follow." I heard a smile in Rathin's voice. "More often he drags me into things. He'll have his way one day, when I'm worn out swordselling and don't care so much about being useful…"

"Maybe I'll settle down one day, too," I said, testing the idea. "I don't want to have kids while I'm still on the road — I'm not sure I could find a man who'd put up with it, anyway. My father was unique."

"Find a man who'll travel alongside you."

"The road's no place to raise kids." But was a village you visited once, twice a year any better? I thought about it… about the road. I liked it. "What about you, Rathin? Ever considered having a family?"

"Not really…"

"What about Anweth? You could be an uncle to his children, or something like that."

"…It's a little complicated," he said.

"You just need to find a woman and go ahead from there."

"Pavadan…" He sounded strangled. "Are you trying to… propose something to me?"

"Not exactly." My tone was too casual, and I knew it gave me away.

Although we were supposed to keep talking, we couldn't find much to say after that.

My first hint that I had fallen asleep came when I was shaken awake.

"Pavadan," a voice whispered in my ear.

I sat up. "Rathin?"

"Come with me." His hand took my own. He sounded as if he were smiling.

"Did you see something? Look, I'm sorry I fell asleep…"

"It's all right. I think a lot of the others did, too. Pavadan—" His voice dropped even lower. "Be very quiet. I think they're in here right now."

"The Pit-keepers?"

"Yes. But look across the Pit — they left their door open."

I looked across a stretch of darkness. There — for a moment I thought I'd imagined it, but no, there really was a darker patch against the inky expanse of the walls.

"Let's go," Rathin said.

What about the others? I almost asked. I should have. But I didn't — with escape so close I could taste it, with the Pit-keepers wandering the night around us and only one way out, I didn't have the courage. It seemed Rathin didn't, either. But come morning, we'd be free. I rose and ran with him across the Pit.

Each moment I expected to be stopped by a Pit-keeper's claws, but we made it, to a hole that had opened into the seamless rock. We slipped inside into a narrow tunnel lined with oily-burning torches. The smell was awful, rancid.

Rathin led me down the corridor, still holding my hand. Our steps rasped on the floor, too loudly. I hesitated to add to the noise, but I needed to ask:

"Do you think there's any chance of getting our weapons back? We should keep an eye out for an armory—"

"Good idea." He looked back and smiled. I'm no sentimentalist, but that smile made my heart flutter. We were really going to make it.

We began to pass more doors, mere gaps in the rock leading to stone-walled chambers. I peered in each, and stopped at one where torchlight glittered on steel.

"Rathin," I said, "here it is."

I grabbed the torch and slipped through the narrow gap, hardly noticing when my hand slipped from his. There were swords, spears, and battle axes, laid on tables and hanging on the walls around us. It didn't take me long to find mine — I'd recognize the red leather grip and that blade more nick than steel anywhere. I took it up, and behind me Rathin said, "Pavadan…"

There was naked longing in his voice. I turned, and instinct told me to keep a good grip on my sword; if it hadn't I would have dropped it from shock and then everything would be over.

The teeth changed first. Rathin's white, not-so-friendly smile grew, lengthened grotesquely, and the rest of his face and body changed with it. I saw the fingernails sprout into claws.

For a moment I thought it all had been a lie. That the real Rathin had never existed, that this was all some monstrous trick. But no. I knew Rathin had been real, that he had a friend named Anweth, that he was a younger child like myself, that like me he longed to be useful — and I knew two other things.

The real Rathin would never have left the others in the Pit, and I shouldn't have either.

And the Pit-keepers didn't take you for showing emotion, not just for that. In the Pit, you doomed yourself by caring for someone, by giving the 'keepers a form to borrow, one you trusted enough to follow to your death.

I hadn't survived the Pit because I was disciplined, I survived because I was cold, uncaring. Well, now I was warm and caring, and I planned to survive anyway.

I swung my sword. The Pit-keeper parried with its claws. Long ago I'd learned a little about two-handed fighting, and I still remembered some — my muscles did, at any rate — because as soon as my first blow was knocked aside, I made another with my hand holding the torch.

The Pit-keeper fell back, claws raised as if to shield it from the flame. My sword went under them, into something that seized at the blade like goo, and the thing went down. I pulled my weapon free, and with the torch still in my other hand I ran into the corridor and down it, back to the Pit.

As I ran, I shouted at the top of my lungs, "ANWETH!"

Maybe the Pit-keepers did put a sleeping spell on their prisoners. But I believe despair alone is wearying enough, and anyway, those being taken away never caused any commotion, because they were lead away by someone they loved. My screams woke every mother's child, and when I reached the Pit they were on their feet, ready to fight, or run, or anything else I suggested.

I waved my torch. "This way! Anybody who can use a weapon, listen up! I've found the armory!"

At the head of them came Rathin. I could have wept. After those first few moments, I'd believed with all my heart that he existed, but I hadn't be certain he wasn't led away in the night by something that looked like Anweth.

It was simple after that, though not exactly easy or quick. We met no one and nothing on our way to the armory, and once we were armed — many of us also bearing torches — the Pit-keepers we did encounter weren't much trouble, though we did suffer injuries and even some losses from those long, slashing claws. There was a moment of white pain when I feared I'd lose my arm, but Rathin's blade ensured it was only my torch that went missing — down something's throat, most likely. It hardly mattered, because by that time we could see the light from the surface.

—

I paced before the entrance of the Pit-keeper's cave, dry prairie grass whipping at my trouser legs, picking at the bandage Maia, the practically-dressed woman, had made from strips of her skirt. I thanked her profusely, probably to excess. The night before I'd run out on her, on every mother's child in the Pit, and I didn't know how to make up for it.

My mother would have run out on them, too.

For a while we rested before the cave, in the hot sun and the cool breeze, waiting to think of something to do. Someone suggested collapsing the tunnel's entrance, and those who could set to that task enthusiastically, hammering with sword hilts and battleaxes until the rock gave in. If any of the Pit-keepers survived, they'd have to find another way out.

With my injured arm, I could only watch. Three months I had been down there. I wasn't sure what to do with myself up here.

Rathin sat beside me. "Hey. I see you took up my battle cry for yourself." His smile faded when I didn't return it. "What's wrong?"

"When the Pit-keeper came for me, it came in disguise. It came as someone it knew I would follow… As you."

"Oh." He said a lot with that almost-word. His arm went around me. I thought I might start crying, but I didn't. Three months of holding in your emotions forms a habit.

"Thank you," he said. "For turning back. You didn't have to, you know. Once you'd found out the danger, you were already free of the Pit. You could have run."

"I couldn't have," I said. "But… thanks. A lot."

—

"What now?" Maia asked. "Do we look for a road? Wait for somebody to come by?"

"We wait," Rathin said. "A friend is looking for me."

"How can you tell?"

"Have you ever been the focus of a finding spell?"

"No…"

"When you are," Rathin said dryly, "you can tell."

"Anweth?" I asked.

"Of course."

I smiled for him.

—

I had already realized how things stood, and when the figure we first saw that afternoon drew closer and closer until it resolved into a slender, dark-robed young man with a silver wizard's circlet in his white-blond hair, I wasn't at all surprised when Rathin greeted him with a lover's kiss. Others might have been, but if they were troubled they didn't show it; these men were, after all, saving our lives.

Knowing why it couldn't have been made things easier. I was disappointed, but watching them speak, catching up on the events of the past few days — more romantic than it sounds — watching Rathin being so happy made things hurt less. Anyway, I was alive. I had a lot to be thankful for.

Anweth led us to a small plains town a few days' travel north. The townsfolk were as startled as you might imagine, but they let us stay in their temple of Astet, and brought blankets and hot soup. The next day, and every few days after, people began to head east and west along the long road, some carrying messages for others. In time, more messengers arrived, ready to escort the weak or timid home to their waiting families. Except me. I stayed in town and waited for a reason to go on.

Rathin gave me one. "Anweth and I are going to the head of the Jewel Trail. Do you want to come with us?"

"Would you mind?"

"Of course not." He looked shocked at the very idea. And Anweth, across the hall, looked up and smiled at me with no trace of jealousy. Of course, he had nothing to be jealous of.

"I'll come," I said. "Thanks for inviting me."

There's not much left to tell. Life goes on. At the head of the Jewel Trail we hired on with different caravans, but that's all right. There aren't that many caravans in the world; we're bound to meet up again sometime. And if we don't, at least we parted friends.

Time in the Pit changed me. I still don't show how I feel much, and I don't sleep so well some nights. And when it comes to what I want, what I plan for… that's changed, too, but maybe for the better. I think of settling down sometimes. But more often I think of reaching out, finding someone, starting something. Something good that I won't abandon, even when the road calls me. If need be, I'll carry it with me. Anything to keep it.

I want to love and be loved. As, I imagine, does every mother's child.
