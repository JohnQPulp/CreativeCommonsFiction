After it became declassified, I would use the trip as the setup for a joke: An Athenian and an Argive wander into a Scythian mercenary camp. Men toweled down horses, eying us beneath high-crowned hats. I gazed over the shallow, houseless valley, pretending not to listen to Philocrates pretending to sell out our homeland to the bearded Scythian chief.

As usual, I was the servant. Philocrates was the lord. His assumptions needed rearrangement.

"Good-looking piece," Philocrates said, hoisting a musket whose red-stained stock could have been carved by the same hand behind the ones we'd recovered from their raids beyond the Ister. Some third of the soldiers in camp carried them on shoulders or saddles. They all wore bows, quivers. Stitched leathers and furs. Some wrapped their feet in rags. I'd been staring; I turned up my face, caught the speck of an asteroid about to cross the eye of the sun on its march through the aether.

"But a bitch to aim mid-gallop," the chief grinned. He nodded to a long, thick tube racked beside his tent. "Not that you need to aim all of them."

Philocrates raised his eyebrows for permission and took up the tube. He turned it, tapped it. Click of bronze. Smiled apologetically. "My man amuses himself studying the weapons of foreign lands."

Prick. I took the tube, muttered "Han" in Hellene. Philocrates nodded fractionally and returned to the subject of our troop positions. The information wasn't current, just recent enough to buy favor without paying in Hellene blood.

Long, bronze, dents down its length, scorch marks on both open ends. Smelled like saltpeter and hell. Two-thirds along, the tube sported a clamp and touch hole like an old matchlock. I nodded and eased it back onto the rack.

Philocrates prattled on. Men left to rummage the grassy hills for rabbits and tubers. Another Titan creased the sun. I'd have been done an hour ago. Philocrates turned the talk to the nomadic patterns of the chief's ancestors. When the chief paused between generations, I stepped forward, head bowed.

"Excuse me, lord. Is it possible for you to sell us one of these firing-tubes?"

The chief smiled indulgently. "Afraid not."

"Pity," Philocrates took up. "I imagine a few of those and we could wreak horror on the Argives."

The man chewed his beard. "Go to Olbia. Find a man named Abchadas. He'll have what you need to kill the Hellenes."

I nodded, masking my rage with a smile. A third Titan had caught the sun before Philocrates fared his wells.

We mounted and headed east across the plains. On the north shore of the Euxine, Olbia would be a week's ride if we couldn't catch an airship.

"So," Philocrates said. "Think they're reinvesting the spoils of war?"

"They don't have any money. Some of those guys don't have shoes."

"Yet they're laden with Han weaponry. What an illogical phenomenon." He brushed brown hair from his eyes. "What's the tube do?"

I shrugged. "Blow things up."

"Really? Fascinating! The Han are magicians with gunpowder, you know. I wonder if they're fire-brained by nature or by incident?"

I pulled my coat close around my shoulders. "I wonder how long before the mercenaries use those things on our people."

"Kemetian," I said, nodding to the wide-spaced ruts in the road to Abchadas' hilltop manor. "Lot of them, too, judging by the depth. Or their chariots are especially heavy."

Philocrates wound a strand of hair around his finger. "Suppose we should catch a ship for the Nile right now?"

"We still don't know how they're funding the raiders."

"But it would spare us an hour of yammering from a rich man. Like apples, they all look different on the outside, but inside, they all carry the same seed: the conviction their wealth was the natural outcome of a healthy cosmos."

"Sounds annoying." Pines and deep green shrubs furred the shoulders of the road. Whiff of the sea. How do you follow money? It doesn't leave the same tracks a man does. It isn't something you can catch, kill, and eat. Money is a notion, as liquid and hard to hold as the aether that surrounds the world and lets us reach for others.

But now I'm starting to sound like Philocrates. Too much time together.

A pair of servants in wool coats greeted us at the gates and tried to peel Philocrates away.

"Andronikos," he hissed. I examined the ironwork elk and eagles mounted on the wall, letting him twist, then waved him on. Abchadas waited for us in a hall of wrought iron and boasts.

"At last," he said through a bear's beard. "What, did you walk here?"

I smiled. "My servant's afraid of traveling on anything higher than a horse."

"He sounds easily replaced."

"More easily than he believes," I said. I doused Philocrates' glare with a look. Abchadas laughed and chatted, showing us around, voice echoing through the empty space he'd captured within his walls. I nodded when I was supposed to, praised when conversation called for praise. After a life in the military, it was second nature.

Philocrates shifted foot to foot, wandered off to eye the animal- and hero-heavy metalwork draped from the walls. I considered killing Abchadas once we had our intel; he was thin-armed and middle-aged. Not that I expected that to dam the tide of arms flowing into Scythia. The gesture was the thing.

We'd come on pretense of arranging a buy. At last, I swung to business.

Abchadas' beard ruffled as he nodded. "Follow me to the courtyard. All deals should be made under the sun."

I snapped my fingers for Philocrates. The courtyard brimmed green, interrupted by reds and yellows and blues.

"Is this your only business?" I sighted down a matchlock pistol, also Han.

"Primarily and most profitably." Abchadas smiled. "Lately I've begun to branch into gardening."

I chuckled. To Abchadas' left, Philocrates pulled a face. The Scythian spoke softly with servants who returned with smoothbore muskets and a new rifled model bearing the owl of Athens. I looked up.

"Got someplace we can give these a test?"

"Holy hells!" Philocrates shrieked from across the garden. I sprinted for him, instincts locking down thought, the slap of Abchadas' heels behind me. Philocrates bent over a waist-high yellow-stemmed plant. Lacy fronds trembled in the breeze. Shining purple petals looped in broad and tangled sprays that looked too heavy to be supported by the tender stem.

"Sir," Abchadas said, head cocked, "I'll ask you not to touch that."

"Where did this come from?" Philocrates gaped. "It's unearthly!"

"And worth two thousand owls. Don't—"

Philocrates reached for a tendril that looked soft as a sigh. Abchadas turned to me, red behind his beard.

"Sir!"

I interposed myself between Philocrates and the plant. "Back off. Or that flower won't be the only thing planted in the dirt."

Abchadas smiled tightly, eyes shining like silver drachmas. We left on the arrangement of a small deal and a false promise for more, the road unspooling toward the bay.

"Flowers," I said.

"Apparently."

"Can they get you high?"

Philocrates rubbed his mouth. "I don't believe so, although it's likely that—"

"The Kemetians are funding a literal war with flowers. At least they'll be easy to spot." I dug my heels into my horse's ribs. "We'll cable our men in Memphis. Catch an airship to Pelousion. See what there is to see."

From the open airship window, Pelousion oozed across the delta, a city of mud in a land of sand and flax. Philocrates slumped in his seat, nausea chiseled on his fine features. I smiled.

We hit the hot streets. Telegrams waited us in the mud-brick office of the local Bridge Between Two Lands cable co. Philocrates plucked them up and began decrypting.

"They're being sold up and down the Nile, but the focus seems to be Memphis." He squinted at me over his papers. "They have ferries upriver, you know."

I booked another flight.

Kemetian cities look the same to me. The same sandy bricks in Memphis as in Pelousion. Same square houses. We had a meet the next day. I toured the streets to get their feel while Philocrates roamed the markets for flowers. The faces of buildings grinned with bright murals. When I got very lucky, I whiffed lamb and cinnamon instead of shit.

The day after we headed for the fountain. On its burbling lip sat our contact Gobryas, a kronos-mooded Persian exile who hated the Kemietians even more than he hated us.

He laughed drily. "You two look like you're enjoying yourselves."

Philocrates smeared sweat from his brow. "I'm working on a theory that excessive heat leads to excessively convoluted government schemes."

"You're looking for Bes and Panhsj Botanical Endeavors," Gobryas said. "They hire day laborers on the south road every morning."

I elbowed Philocrates' ribs. "Don't worry, we'll find you some gloves."

"Unlike our quarry, I am not a delicate flower."

Gobryas spat into the dirt. "I don't know why I'm doing this. I should just let you two peoples destroy each other."

I shrugged. "If you've seen war, you know nobody deserves it."

"Or maybe we all do."

I gave him an address to pick up his fee and we headed off for bad haircuts and shabby clothes. As we searched for a barber willing to do slipshod work ("Anyone can cut hair nicely. True artistry lies in deliberately doing so poorly," Philocrates tried to explain), Philocrates told me about a near-riot down on the docks when three of the plants had gone up for auction.

"It was as if they were bidding on a new form of gold. Or their own souls." He paused in the shade of an etched limestone lintel. "It's called the husesen, by the way."

We chopped our hair, frayed our robes, dirtied our skins. The following morning we looked no different from any of the others clustered around the south road. Possibly a mistake — the B&P wagoner looked right past us, beckoning a half dozen others on board.

In this way we wasted a week. Afternoons, we sniffed after the husesen and turned up crumbs. Only available through B&P. Very expensive. Their origin, you may as well ask what formed the stars.

Finally, the wagoner ushered us onto the stinking boards. We rattled away from the mud-smog of Memphis. The dirt road branched, taking us to a line of boundary stones demarcating tidy green rows and empty churned dirt.

And row on row of red-headed poppies.

We harvested seeds. Clipped flowers. Hoed dirt. Dug onions. Carried water. We sweated and blistered and slapped flies. Far across the fields, beyond a wire fence, men with muskets prowled the empty space around high brick buildings.

During rests, we wandered nearer. A gleaming chariot rolled to the wire gates, garnered inspection, and entered.

"Whatever's in there," Philocrates panted, "it's not to be seen by the likes of us. Naturally, then, our coworkers will be more curious than those who work inside the building, and likely better-informed."

I doubted this. But by the second day, he introduced me to a short and wiry Kermanai named Menali.

"Husesen, they inside," he said in wounded Kemetian. "A hundreds. Wall to wall."

"They grow them there?" Philocrates said.

Menali grinned the grin of a man who spots the fish beneath the surface. "No. Not grown. Brought in."

Philocrates turned to me, mouth a white line. "We're no closer—"

"Big ship," Menali finished. "Nobody knows when."

"I wonder what they look like," I said, misdirecting.

"That, you can't say. Do they light up in darkness? This is so I hear."

"Amazing," Philocrates said. That night on our road back to Memphis, he said, "He must have meant an airship. Just by watching its course we'll be able to narrow down its origin."

"I don't know." I rubbed my back. "Think you can make it another week?"

"I haven't been one of your pampered Assembly speakers in years. Do you keep droning on about that out of laziness? Or because your brain's still catching up?"

I didn't say much on the way back to our one-room apartment. And now a new ship to chase? An end to the journey: did it exist, now the world had grown so large?

With his usual pride, Philocrates once told me of an argument he'd had with a priest about the nature of the aether. The priest held that the invisible aether surrounding our planet, its debris ring, and the moon — and who knew how much further — was the exhalation of Zeus. Only a heavenly breath that could support us, wherever we went, as if we walked on Earth.

Philocrates countered that air, when exhaled, can't keep anyone alive, at least not very long. Yet men can breathe aether. Therefore, the aether couldn't be the exhaled air of any god, Zeus or not.

The priest replied with something about the internal working of gods differing from our own. Philocrates took that as a confession of defeat. I expect both men went home saying they'd won: Philocrates because he always does, the priest because the debate only proved a natural philosopher will ignore the grandeur of Olympus as soon as the smallest mote of logic catches his eye.

I don't know what the aether is. But I've fought enough wars to know the difference between an airship and an aethership. Airship bodies and balloons are long cylinders, fish-like, meant to cleave the seas of air. In the sky above the guarded brick building, the descending ship bore three spherical balloons over a fat and blocky gondola.

"That's no airship," Philocrates said. I cocked my head. He went on, "I crewed one in the War of Aegean Hegemony. Auxiliary strategist."

"Great. Figure out how we'll get on board."

"Now?"

"We don't know when it'll be back."

"I would propose," he said, shifting his robes on his shoulders, "we return to Memphis, cable Athens, and arrange a flight on a ship of our own."

"It's headed into the aether. We'll have no clue where it goes from there. Like trying to follow a fish through the ocean." I chunked my hoe into the soil. "You're the thinker, aren't you? We can count on two hours. Get thinking."

"What I think is you're asking me to plan our suicide."

I hefted the hoe. I think better when I'm working. Beyond the wire fence, the ship touched down in a wreath of sand and steam. Wouldn't matter too much if we bought the farm. We'd cabled Athens last night. They knew everything we did.

"Consider the aethership," Philocrates said softly some time later.

A rectangular box under three bulging spheres. Landing rails beneath the box. Stylized vulture painted on its side. "Consider it considered."

"Unlike their air and sea-going counterparts, the top deck of an aethership is closed. If a man were to climb on top of it and install himself there between it and the balloons, spotting him would be very difficult."

I blinked. Not just for the sweat in my eyes. "That's the best you can do?"

"With this little time, preparation, and resources? You're lucky I'm not asking us to cling like lemurs to the landing rails."

I grinned. A ladder tongued down from the belly of the ship to cough out crates and personnel. Men came and went. No strict security per se: guards roamed the grounds, monitored the buildings and gate, sometimes glanced shipward. Risky. Not impossible.

Unloading became loading. Time to move. We picked up buckets and headed for the stream. Knee-high grass became waist-high reeds. We left our buckets on the bank and doubled back for the fenced-off field, crouching, belly-crawling when the grasses dipped. I reached the fence and shimmied under.

A hundred yards from the ship, its balloons straining under ropes and clasps. Traffic came and went from the ladder. I swung around for the stern.

"Who's there?"

I froze. A tan arm parted the grass in front of my face. I grabbed it, yanked the man down beside me. He opened his mouth and I jammed my forearm between his teeth. He bit down, drawing blood; I jammed harder. Fingers scraped my cheeks, seeking eyes. I thrashed my head and the fingers clamped for my throat. I saw spots, flashes. Philocrates hunched behind me, gaping. The man leaned his weight over me, snot spraying from his flaring nostrils, molars grinding the meat of my arm. I reached between his legs and crushed his balls. He dropped my throat and I punched his, dropping him. I struck until his eyelids drooped.

Wind tousled the grass. Light conversation carried from the ladder. I gasped back my breath.

The guard carried a curved sword and single-shot pistol. I snugged them both beneath my robes. Philocrates wouldn't meet my eyes. We crawled on until the ship hung above us, a beast of wood and tin and brass, body blocking us from sight. I reached above my head, grasped the neck of an iron vulture, and hauled myself hand over hand.

I rolled onto the roof, panting. Philocrates followed moments later. If anyone saw us, they hadn't made any noise about it. We crawled to the middle and flattened down.

"That was so fast," Philocrates murmured.

I paused, clamping hands with a sudden pang of pity. "It doesn't matter how you react. All that matters is you don't do nothing."

The engines kicked on a few minutes later; my hand snaked for a rope. That big wooden body mumbled and thrummed. I tangled my legs into the cabling as the ship jerked and lifted.

I didn't risk a look until I'd counted five minutes. At the roof's lip, wind swirling my hair, the Nile peeled a vast green ribbon through a sprawl of brown and yellow. I swallowed.

Clouds wrapped us in a damp blanket. Philocrates squeezed his eyes tight. I pulled my robes tight against the leeching chill. The clouds ebbed to nothing. Beyond the great, steaming bubbles, the sky darkened like the water beyond an undersea cliff, first a perfect blue, then a star-pricked, twinkling blackness. As we moved from air to aether, the bone-cold subsided for an uneasy cool.

The engines hushed. My limbs, when I shifted, moved as lightly as if I were swimming. I jerked against the feeling of falling, propelling myself into a tangle of ropes.

"What in Hades?"

"Hold tight!" Philocrates said, hair billowing around his head. "As matter is by nature drawn to other matter, the Earth's grip slackens as you leave its mass behind. We won't feel that hold again until we reach another body."

I squirmed, palms sweating, hauling my weightless body back for the solid wood roof. I glimpsed the world, whorls of white over sweeps of blue and green. Something in that vision calmed me. A deep terror, too, but so deep I could give in, knowing I'd have no way to fight.

I focused on my breathing. If my body knew a difference between aether and air, I couldn't feel it.

Hours later a new body swelled beyond the curves of the balloons, a patch-haired thing of green and gray. The sky tilted and I swallowed down my breakfast. The ship swung through what felt like half an arc, impossible to tell, before steadying and venting great gouts of steam. The grasp of weight resumed, first light as silk, then a firm but fractional hold.

I glared at Philocrates. "You didn't tell me it would be like this."

"I thought nothing was too rough for your calloused experience."

The ship jarred down, clacking my teeth shut. More steam, thumps and hollers from the cabin beneath us. The balloons sagged like the muscles of a dead deer; would they suffocate us? The ship rocked. Voices rang through the open aether now, oddly hollow.

I waited for the last man to fade into silence before I rose. Crazed plants sprang from the dirt, broad-leafed, pale green and deep yellow. Some stretches lay barren. Rocky and empty as the crown of a mountain.

Philocrates narrowed his eyes. "One of the Titans. Hyperion, gauging by its curve. Locating the husesens here could be a complicated task."

"If they're here at all." Nobody stirred the meadow below. I climbed down effortlessly, landed with a pat. I hadn't seen where the crew had gone. Tracks led everywhere. I bared my teeth and headed for the vague direction where the voices had departed.

The grass plunged into a sweet-smelling bog. We splashed forward, parting man-high reeds. Footprints here and there. I hacked at clogging bushes, their nimble branches self-woven like a tangled net. Abruptly, the land sloped into a jungle of weeds and flowers. Arm-thick stems supported heads as broad as barrels. Blues, purples, blacks, specks and streaks of yellows and reds and whites.

I lost the trail. Now and then what I hoped was a breeze rustled the petals and leaves. I doubled back, found nothing. The crush of plants screened out the sky.

"Are we lost?" Philocrates whispered.

"We need to find a hill."

That took doing. By the time we emerged from the flowering forest to a bare ridge, the Earth hung beside the sun in the black sky. Night fell with the swiftness of a bird.

I scanned the darkened land. No fires, no lights. "I'm out of my element, Philocrates."

"All lands look foreign to virgin eyes. Look, there's a light just over there."

I followed his arm. Less than a mile away, a prick of light appeared from a shadowy meadow. It brightened as I watched, joined by others.

"Mark the direction," I said. "And be quiet."

We climbed down into a new forest that soon broke into a flat plain of grass. Patches glowed like stolen moonlight.

"See any houses?" I said. "Any people?"

I got out the pistol and crouched forward. I don't know who stopped first. Yellow-stemmed, purple-fronded husesen spread above the grass, spilling silvery light across the plain.

"Xenophytes!" Philocrates laughed. "I knew it!"

He bounded forward. I kept watch while he made notes, harvested seeds, took clumsy clippings. Beyond the flowers' glow, I squinted stones rising from the gloom. Ruins. When I pointed them out, Philocrates bounded off like a wind-up toy. Crumbled walls bore foreign glyphs and figures, too timeworn to make out. Beside them lay a wide and well-trampled landing field and a narrow building of fresh stone covered in Kemetian murals. In its courtyard loomed a monstrous wheeled engine of wood and rope. A long arm extended from its center, straining beneath its cocked tension, a sling dangling from its end. The unblinking Earth gazed with us.

"That," I said, "is an enormous catapult."

Despite the clear Kemetian presence, we found no one inside the building. Desks and papers, which Philocrates took to like the proverbial moth. I poked around, found a warehouse of aethership tackle, sat down on a bundle of canvas to rest my eyes.

"Andronikos!"

I jolted awake. Early dawn filtered throw the slitted windows. I rushed to the study, sword in one hand, pistol in the other. Philocrates rushed toward me and waved a handful of papers in my face.

"The catapult! They mean to bombard us with it!"

"You're sleep-mad. Even if they could fling something free of the Titan's grip, it would wind up on the other side of the planet."

"The Earth's face hasn't changed since we've been here. It's as if this asteroid's locked in place." His red eyes bulged. "A normal catapult can knock down walls. What do you think would happen if they launched a boulder from here?"

Natural philosophers. "I've worked with artillery. They couldn't hit the Aegean from here, let alone a city."

"If they keep working on this, they'll find a way."

A man with a shaved head and white robe leaned through the doorway, blanched, and disappeared. I ran after him while Philocrates stuffed papers in his robe. Men shouted in Kemetian from the landing field. A small ship rested a couple hundred yards away, still venting steam.

"We should run," I said.

"To hide up here eating alien flowers?" Philocrates' eyes swung toward the catapult. He giggled. "Did you see any cloth in there? Big cloth. Something you could make a sail out of."

"There's a room full of rigging and supplies off the study."

His eyes and mouth rounded. "Hold them off! Don't let them near the machine!"

He sprinted inside. Across the field, men scrambled in and out of the ship. Steel flashed. A lone musket crashed, echoing through the ruins. I knelt and rested my firing arm across a rock.

There's always a brave one. A man in a loincloth rushed from the ship, a curved blade glinting over his head. I let him get within twenty feet, shot him in the chest, and collected his sword from the grass. In response, a half dozen advancing soldiers dropped prone and began sniping from the grass. Smoke billowed from their barrels. A ball bounced from my stone cover with a dumb whine.

"Put this on!" Philocrates emerged from the building clutching two strapped packs to his chest. He hurled one at me. In the low weight, I had to leap to snag it from the air. "Come on. Now."

He raced for the catapult in long strides. I broke cover. Shouts and shots replied across the field. Philocrates jumped for the machine's long arm, clung to it, and clambered into the slack sling.

"Get in!"

For a moment, I forgot all about the armed men rushing our way. "We'll be dashed across Attica!"

"I'm not doing nothing! Trust me and get in here, you thoughtless loaf!"

I made my peace and jumped for the sling. Philocrates grabbed my arm, hauling me inside with a strength he'd never have on Earth. He snatched my sword and swung it at the machine's pin. The wooden creak, the bodily jolt; I don't know which assaulted me harder.

We sailed into empty space.

Smoke puffed below us, futile parting shots. Philocrates pounded me on my shouldered pack, grinning like a drunk on his birthday. "Parachutes. Standard issue on military airships. If we handle ourselves right, we may land in a friendly place."

"If I'd eaten in the last day, I'd be vomiting right now."

"Oh, I brought some husesen seeds, too. Kemet won't have its monopoly for long." His glee melted into troubled pensivity. "We'll have to come up here ourselves, you know. Build our own platforms. The only way to dissuade Kemet will be to convince them we can respond in kind."

"I don't like where that thought leads me."

Philocrates equivocated, then launched into a lecture on the proper operation of a parachute. Earth soared above us — or did it rest below? — ready to take back its two unlikely birds.
