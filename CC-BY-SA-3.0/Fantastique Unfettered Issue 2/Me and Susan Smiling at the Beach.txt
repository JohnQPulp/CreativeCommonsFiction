Susan called a couple of weeks ago. Just like that — as if ten years of silence had been nothing more than an awkward pause in a long conversation. I recognized her voice immediately — low and smoky. Back in the old days it could quickly change registers and erupt into a bright peal of laughter. I had always been able to make her laugh.

"I have some vacation coming up," she said. She wasted no time, dispensing with our small talk after the how-are-yous. Something told me she wasn't in a laughing mood.

"Mm?" It was the best I could manage.

"I was thinking about flying out to see you."

After Susan had left me, she met someone new and moved to Florida. They married. I don't know whether they had children or not, or even if she was still with the guy. A lot can happen in ten years. Maybe there was trouble at home and she was laying the groundwork for an affair. Maybe she had divorced and was hoping to rekindle our old romance. Maybe, hoping to allay any regrets or perhaps compare me to her husband, she was curious to see what type of person I had grown into. We had always said that no matter what happened we'd remain friends. We hadn't, of course, but any bitterness I had felt had long since died and the memories I had of her and I were, for the most part, happy.

So there we were, after exchanging a handful of sentences over the telephone, falling right back into that silence, adding long seconds to our running tally of ten years. She needed my answer.

"Come out," I said.

"I'll be there on Tuesday. My flight gets in at three."

—

It wasn't like me to make rash decisions. Susan's visit could potentially turn my life on its ear, or so I told myself. But the truth was, aside from the job I kept at a company specializing in wireless communication, I would not have a great deal of trouble accommodating a guest. I had fallen into a state in which I half-expected to spend the rest of my life, neither terribly happy nor terribly sad. Life had offered me a kind of numb comfort and I took it, perhaps out of fear that a large disturbance in any direction would knock me out of whack and send my boat for choppy waters.

She had rung off before I could get any more information out of her. I didn't want to bombard her with questions — I knew I'd get all the answers I needed when I saw her in person. Maybe I had been in a ten-year rut and needed a mystery.

I dug out from my closet an old shoe box filled with photographs; me and Susan at the Shedd Aquarium; Susan in the kitchen, rolling pizza crust with her hair pulled back, her hands dusted with flour; me and Susan smiling at the beach. She was a pretty girl, with long brown hair — much too pretty for a guy like me. But I had made her laugh. I wondered if she were still pretty. She was still plenty young, but people our age stand at a crossroads in terms of physical attractiveness — we have been presented with ample opportunities to let ourselves go and many among us, especially those lulled by the false sense of security that comes with marriage, relax by slow degrees — until the day we wake up and find ourselves no longer young or attractive.

I didn't expect it would be the case with Susan. Even when a year into our relationship Susan quit smoking she didn't gain an ounce. She had been a regular runner and kept to a reasonably healthy diet. In her early twenties she was radiant, the type that was sure to age gracefully. I had even met her mother and in my mind breathed a relieved sigh — for Susan, it was one possible future I could happily accept.

Again I looked at the photograph of us at the beach, Susan tan and trim in her bikini. She was a generous lover and if she lacked anything in the realm of acrobatics she more than made up for it in enthusiasm. Sometimes she'd even apologize afterwards, as if she had fumbled her way through our coupling and somehow left me less than satisfied. Nothing could have been further from the truth. I held a secret hope that that part of Susan still existed and, if things went well, we'd have occasion to revisit those old times.

Truth be told, Susan's ending our relationship had hurt me more than I ever let on. Some part of me had always longed for her and perhaps always would. Over the past ten years I had mapped in my mind possible realities in which she had not moved away, realities in which we stayed together, moved in, got married, did all of those things that people in love do. I have never been able to give myself fully to a woman since and as a result, the bulk of my time I passed alone. Let her come, I thought. Any change she brings will be welcome.

—

I drove to the airport and waited at the terminal for Susan to disembark. We hadn't talked since the day she called, so the possibility that she wasn't on the flight was at the forefront of my mind. The door opened and, led by a flight attendant pushing a red wheelbarrow, passengers began to file out of the jet bridge and into the terminal. I stood up, ran a hand through my hair, and searched the weary travelers. With each unfamiliar face that appeared in the corridor, my hope diminished. Had Susan called me out just to stand me up? Maybe, in nervous anticipation that I was not the same Charlie anymore, she had been unable to board the airplane and close the distance between us.

When traffic out of the airplane had stopped, I walked to the open doorway to peer down the jet bridge. A man in a pilot's uniform sauntered toward me and, reading my face like a question, put a hand on my shoulder.

"Sorry, son. There's no one else."

There was nothing to do but go home. So much for Susan, so much for my all my plans. I turned and began to walk away when I heard her voice behind me.

"I was beginning to think you changed your mind."

"I was thinking the exact—" I spun on my heel to track the voice. I faced not Susan, but the red-haired flight attendant, the first to leave the airplane. She smiled a pretty smile at me, but blinked in rapid succession as if trying to fight back some emotion bubbling within. She was an attractive woman to be sure, but not Susan.

"I'm sorry," I said. "I thought you were someone else."

"Down here, silly."

I followed the flight attendant's slender arms down to the wooden handles of the wheelbarrow she clutched in her pale hands — I traced the lacquered arms of the wheelbarrow to the shiny red basin. I was scarcely prepared for what I saw inside. Could this amorphous lump of flesh and hair be the woman I once loved? Completely naked, with only a blanket between her skin and the cold metal, the thing inside conformed to the basin's shape like a dollop of tapioca pudding. I could discern neither arms nor legs and the face seemed anchored by only the most tentative force — there were her blue eyes all right, staring up at me from some willy-nilly place on what I would hesitate to call a body. The brown hair that had once fallen onto her tanned shoulders now floated atop her shapelessness like a slime-slicked curl of seaweed on a pool of stagnant water.

"Susan?"

"Unobservant as ever, I see," the thing in the wheelbarrow chuckled. "It's good to see you, Charlie."

—

I couldn't get Susan into my coupe. I had to hail a cab — one of those minivans with a removable back seat. Fortunately, she had checked no luggage; the sum of her travel necessities amounted to a blanket and wheelbarrow. Susan said she was hungry — airlines these days were unwilling to part with more than a bag of pretzels and a half-cup of orange juice. She suggested we stop at Pruebelo, a little Mexican restaurant that we had gone to from time to time for tacos and happy hour margaritas. She said it sounded like a great idea.

I took mine on the rocks, she blended — and with a straw so that I could lower the glass to her level and help her drink. The waiter, consummate professional he was, held an unfaltering smile as he pulled a chair away from the table to accommodate the wheelbarrow. Susan seemed happy on the surface, though I had the feeling that something was wrong — why else would she come halfway across the country to see me?

"How's your husband?"

"He's good."

Again came the silence that had become a recurring theme in our relationship. It had not always been that way. When we were together, we always had something to talk about — even the quiet times carried with them no awkwardness. Maybe it was easier because then we were young and the future seemed far away.

I wanted to ask her what had happened to change her so, but decided to wait, not wanting to seem overly eager to bring up a potentially delicate subject. It seemed to me that Susan had no skeleton, that she had been deboned like a fish. Her arms and legs were gone, or had been stretched to the point of nonexistence by her lack of inner framework. It was not that she had put on weight, rather than her weight had been redistributed with her new shape. Susan looked up at me and smiled. Somehow she was able to keep her facial features oriented. She could face upward and slightly forward, as if she possessed some limited range of motion. I fed her a taco, being careful not to spill meat on her naked body. I wiped her mouth with a paper napkin, took a drink, and held up my glass to order another.

"How long you here?"

"As long as you can stand me. I got an open-ended ticket," she said.

"That must've cost a fortune," I said. I didn't want to offer my opinion on the subject of her departure just yet. "Is there anything special you want to do while you're here?"

"All the old things," she said. "Everything we used to do."

—

I took my bed apart and leaned the disassembled frame and box spring mattress against the wall. With just the top mattress resting on the floor, I could spill Susan out of the wheelbarrow and into bed. I tipped the wheelbarrow and poured her onto the bed. She rolled out like warm, flesh-colored taffy. I saw a couple of fingernails — maybe toenails, and a little dimple I took to be her navel — the navel I had so long ago probed with my tongue, prompting Susan to pull up her legs and giggle and squirm. A triangular patch of pubic hair slipped over the lip of the wheelbarrow, soon followed by her facial features, which flopped forward onto the mattress. Her muffled cries for help began immediately — she'd suffocate if I didn't do something. I thrust my hands into her doughy body and strained to lift her, having no more elaborate a plan than to keep shifting her mass until her face was no longer under her body. I have never been terribly strong. I could feel my stomach muscles strain and beginnings of cramps in my forearms. I struggled — it was like trying to gather a gigantic wet blanket in my arms; the more I turned her weight, the less I felt I was making any progress. Finally I heard her voice, clear and loud.

"Charlie! It's okay! You can put me down!"

I dropped her and she landed on the mattress with a phumph. There she was, looking up at me with those blue eyes, breathing hard but smiling.

"My," she said. "You're really red."

"Yeah," I said, gasping. "I imagine I am."

I started to laugh. I don't know why. I didn't find things particularly funny. Rather, I wanted to cry or scream or run away. Susan joined me laughing. Susan, the blob on my bed. For a second our laughter took on a conspiratorial quality, as if she were reading my mind and me hers.

—

I spent the night on the couch. Susan said that I didn't have to — she didn't want to put me out. But she was a guest and I wanted her to be comfortable. Besides, I had fallen asleep on the couch plenty of times watching television.

I got little sleep. The thought of what lie on the other side of the living room wall was not easily shooed from my mind. Through the vent set near the ceiling, I could hear the steady, muffled sound of Susan's voice. I thought at first she had developed the habit of talking in her sleep. I got up from the couch to try and listen in. Perhaps whatever she was saying could shed some light on her situation. But when I neared the register I realized that Susan was not talking. She was crying.

—

We had a picnic at the park the next day — it wasn't much of a park. During our senior year in college we had frequented it because it was just a short walk from a house I had rented on the east side of town. On a tuft of grass overlooking a reed-rimmed pond we ate sandwiches and pasta salad, a meal I had prepared in the morning while Susan, tired from her flight, slept in.

"This is just what I wanted, Charlie," Susan said. "Thanks."

"Wait," I said. "There's more." I took a towel-wrapped bottle of chilled Chardonnay from the backpack I had worn, along with a couple of plastic wine glasses. I assembled them, attaching the stems and feet to the bowls, and poured two glasses. The sunlight caught the wine and shot the plastic cup full of light and a bright topaz formed inside. A breeze rustled the cattails and rippled the water. I kneeled and brought the glass over the lip of the wheelbarrow. Susan sat up, so that some of her mass was resting on the back of the bucket, as one does against a pillow while reading in bed. Whatever musculature it was that worked inside the shapeless lump of her body had pulled her face up and forward facing, allowing me to tilt the wine glass to her lips without spilling.

"What's this?" she asked.

"Chardonnay," I said.

"I know it's Chardonnay," she said. "But since when do we drink it out of glasses?" She put on a smile and batted her eyelashes. If her facial features could be isolated, Susan would indeed be the same pretty girl I had known — though that prettiness was now but a vessel adrift on an unchartable sea of repulsiveness. "On picnics we always used drink from the bottle, passing it back and forth. Don't you remember?"

I remembered. Of course I remembered.

"I don't know," I said. "I don't want to chip a tooth."

—

Having now had some experience in the matter, it was easier getting Susan into bed that night. I threw a thin blanket over most of her, not so much because she was cold, but to give my eyes a break from the frightening tedium that came with the gravity she exuded. What had made her that way? She seemed reluctant to talk about it. The smile she had put on so many times since she arrived seemed to mask a profound sadness. I had always been able to detect Susan's mood shifts, no matter how subtle. Something inside her had changed over the past ten years. She was no longer the bright, athletic girl I had loved. Something had happened in Florida that had robbed her of her cheerfulness. Physical transformation aside, the Susan who lay on my bed was not the same who had ten years ago traded one peninsula for another and left her absence hanging like a fog in my lonely little home.

I stood in the doorway, my hand on the light switch, when Susan spoke.

"He left me," she said. "Steve's gone."

"Steve?" I searched my memory.

"My husband," she said. "My ex-husband."

I had never even known the guy's name. Steve… it somehow seemed appropriate. A flame of jealousy leapt through my guts and was gone. I did not know what to say.

"The divorce was final last week. I had to get out of there. That place. It was too… Depressing."

With that she started to sob. Tears rolled out of her eyes, over the shallow convexity of her body, and onto the bed. Great, sad convulsions rippled through her. I thought of the night, long ago, when she had gotten a call from her mother that a beloved cat had to be put to sleep. Leaning against the wall, she sat on the kitchen floor and cried, her long legs thrust out in front of her. Her hair fell on her face and I could only see flashes of her dewy eyes and wet red cheeks as she drew a hand across to wipe her tears. Slowly losing the willingness to sit, she slid down the wall until she was lying on the floor. She was radiant, even then. I sat down next to her. We hadn't been together very long and I was unsure how to go about the business of offering comfort. I gave her my hand and she took it damply in hers. Before long, I was lying next to her with my hand on her stomach and my nose, lost in a tangle of hair and tears, itching as its tip brushed her warm cheek. I recall even then the desire such closeness stirred in me, and the niggling sense of guilt that came with wanting someone so vulnerable.

"I'm sorry to hear about the divorce," I said. I left the light on and began taking tentative steps toward the mattress. The lump under the blanket jiggled with its rhythmic gasping. "Look," I continued, not really knowing what I was going to say. "You're on vacation now. You don't have to think about it — about any of it. You're here now and let's just make the most of it."

She kept crying. I tried again. "We can do anything you want while you're here. You're in my hands now. Think of me as your personal assistant."

It seemed to help. Susan's crying had quieted and after a couple of soft sniffles she offered a feeble "Okay."

"That's better," I said. "I'm going to turn out the light now."

"You don't have to sleep on the couch." She said it quickly, as if her words were in a race against me to the door. "There's plenty of room in bed."

"You're tired," I said. "You need some rest. I tend to toss and turn. You'd be better off without me."

My sleep was fitful. Each time I awoke, I could hear Susan's steady sobbing through the vent in the wall that separated the living room from the bedroom. The happy face she put on during the day seemed so easily cast aside at night. I thought of that other bit of information Susan had neglected to share with me: How much longer was she planning to stay?

—

We spent the next day at the zoo — Susan seemed somewhat cheered by the animals — and in the evening took an early dinner at an Italian restaurant.

"I'm sorry if I'm a lot to put up with," she said.

"Not at all. It's nice having you here. It's no disruption at all, really."

"You're not seeing anyone?"

"Me? No…"

"It's hard to believe. You were always so sweet. I can't believe no one's come along and scooped you up."

"I've dodged a few bullets," I lied. Susan flashed a brief smile at this, as if it somehow confirmed to her idea of the Charlie she had left in Michigan.

"You're sure I'm not a bother? I feel like you're always having to tend to me."

"It's no worse than the time you quit smoking," I said. "That was a bother. In fact, I sometimes think it's the real reason we broke up."

"Oh," she said and cast her in another direction. "Steve never did like my smoking."

"Steve?"

"I've got a confession, Charlie."

We stopped eating and Susan told me about Steve. She had met him while we were still together and they started seeing each other on the sly. It prompted her to quit smoking. I had never smoked, but Susan's habit never bothered me — I had always thought her quitting was more of a strain than the habit itself. Steve, apparently, saw it differently. Susan had always told me it was something she was doing for herself. The serene days we had passed together became punctuated by flashes of white-hot argument — instances I had chalked up to Susan going through nicotine withdrawal. Before long, we were over and I had no idea the real reason why until now.

"I'm sorry, Charlie," she said. She had tears in her eyes.

"It was all so long ago. Water under the bridge, right?"

"I've always regretted it. Even when I was happy with Steve. It was unfair to you. And now look where it's got me."

"We don't have to talk about this," I said. "It's ancient history. Who cares? Let's eat." I stabbed my fork into my spaghetti noodles and twirled them.

She smiled. Either my lack of a strong reaction or the act of confession had given her some relief.

"I'm not hungry anymore," she said. "Look at us. All we do is eat."

"That's what people do."

"Why haven't you taken me to the beach?" she asked.

—

I parked the van I had rented for Susan's stay at the State Park and wheeled her down the ramp. I knew it would be folly to push Susan's wheelbarrow across the sand, so we opted for a walk to the end of the pier. The sunsets, with only the wavy expanse of Lake Michigan to contrast with the sky, are some of the most beautiful I have ever seen. Gray swaths of woolly clouds stretched themselves at lazy angles to the horizon and the sky was already showing sherbet colors of pink and orange. The red lighthouse stood sentry at the end of the structure, sweeping the sky with its silvery eye.

Ignoring the warning signs—"This Structure Is Not Designed for Public Access: Walk At Your Own Risk"—and passing the stone memorial dedicated to the lives of those lost on the pier, I wheeled Susan along. The wheel bumped over the ruts in the concrete and I had to steer in and out of the iron struts of the catwalk in order to negotiate a clear path. There were surprisingly few people out for such a mild evening. Susan, like a child in a stroller, had the luxury of watching the world unfold before her. She took in the scene with a gloss-eyed wonder.

"Oh, this is lovely, Charlie."

A couple of old fisherman dangled their legs over the edge and sat patiently with their poles poised in the air, hoping to land a straggler from the late summer salmon run. A pair of teenage girls giggled into their fingers when they saw us pass. A couple holding hands made a show of looking the other direction and I felt lonelier than ever.

I maneuvered Susan past the lighthouse and we found ourselves on the platform with nothing between us and the horizon but a field of copper-green water. I looked down at her. She seemed happier, as if her confession had cleared her conscience. But what was the point? I certainly didn't feel any better. In fact, I felt like an old wound had been re-opened. When Susan and I ended I was heartbroken. Now there was another layer on top of it — I had been deceived. She had brought it on herself, whatever it was that had transformed her into this hideous thing. She deserved her sadness, her jellyfish body. No wonder Steve had left her — how could you blame him? But I was jumping to conclusions; I did not know when Susan's transformation took place. It very well could have happened after Steve left.

As Susan admired the changing sky, I looked at the waters that lapped the lip of the pier. I could push her and the wheelbarrow right off the edge and be done with it. Who would miss her? I looked around and saw nobody nearby, except for the fishermen halfway down the length of the pier, intent on their bobbers. I grabbed the wooden handles of the wheelbarrow and moved toward the edge.

"Charlie, what are you doing?"

I kept walking.

"Christ, Charlie, be careful. Don't forget I can't swim."

"Oh. Sorry." I stopped pushing the wheelbarrow, its single tire at the edge of the concrete. I didn't have it in me. I wasn't cut out for murder. I pointed at the water. "Sometimes you can see fish swimming along those rocks."

—

We spent the next two days inside. The sadness Susan had brought with her began to take a hold of me. On the second night Susan confessed that she had regretted leaving me for Steve. It was the greatest mistake of her life, she said, and that she had come back to salvage whatever vestige of our relationship she could. I too had made a mistake. I opened the door to the past and let Susan through. I felt like my insides were slowly turning to mush.

I put her in my bed and steeled myself to ask a question I had been afraid to ask.

"Are you planning on going home anytime soon?"

"No, Charlie. I'm not."

I had somehow suspected it. "You mean you're not going back to Florida?"

"Florida doesn't exist anymore."

Doesn't exist? Was she speaking some sort of riddle? "You mean it doesn't exist for you anymore."

"It doesn't exist at all, Charlie, because I said it doesn't."

"I don't believe you," I said, tightening my chest as I spoke to try and disguise a shaky voice.

"Check a map," she said.

I took the atlas from my bookshelf and looked at a map of the United States. Sure enough, Florida was gone. The Southeastern corner of the country met the ocean smoothly with the rounded coastlines of Alabama and Georgia.

"I'll be damned," I said. I was completely under her power. I could no longer see things for what they were.

"Now are you coming to bed or what?"

I hesitated. "I guess I am."

I lifted up the covers. Susan was waiting, naked and formless. I climbed in.

"Come to me, my darling."

I did. I lay on my side and put a hand on her yielding flesh, knowing that she'd never leave, that she'd never allow Florida to come back. The ten years we had spent apart was our silent pact of sorrow. It was too late to try and pretend that things could be like they had been. But we were together again nevertheless. I kissed her on the lips. Somewhere deep inside my body I felt something go slack, as if some air I had for too long held in my lungs had escaped and left me deflated.
